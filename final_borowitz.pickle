VMONTGOMERY (The Borowitz Report)\u2014A week of turmoil in Alabama culminated on Friday with the United States ordering the Southern state to grow up. After a week in which Alabama exhibited various displays of childishness\u2014including kicking, screaming, stamping its feet, and threatening to hold its breath\u2014the United States decided to take the extraordinary action of telling the hundred-and-ninety-five-year-old state to act its age.  But any hopes that the United States\u2019 order would be heeded were dashed when Alabama put its fingers in its ears and emitted a stream of monosyllabic nonsense sounds, claiming that the order had been rendered inaudible. That action may have only served to provoke the United States, which issued a subsequent statement characterizing the nation\u2019s twenty-second state as nothing but a big crybaby. While the United States clearly hoped that that final statement would cause Alabama to think long and hard about what it had done, the state\u2019s official response\u2014\u201dI know you are but what am I?\u201d\u2014was not encouraging, officials said.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014President Barack Obama was \u201ctotally furious\u201d he spent a week of his time posing for a trillion-dollar platinum coin that would never be minted, a White House source confirmed today. \u201cThe President is a super-busy man, so it\u2019s understandable that he\u2019d be mad,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he has time to sit still for hours on end for a coin that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d         Mr. Obama devoted much of last week to posing for the trillion-dollar coin on the assurances of outgoing Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who told Mr. Obama that the coin had \u201ca way better than fifty percent chance\u201d of being minted. Based on Mr. Geithner\u2019s advice, Mr. Obama carved hours out of his schedule to pose for the ill-fated coin, even cutting short meetings with world leaders such as Afghan President Hamid Karzai. But even as he posed for it, Mr. Obama seemed \u201cfidgety and skeptical\u201d that the platinum coin would ever see the light of day. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve got things to do. Is this coin really going to happen, because if not, this whole thing is really messed up,\u2019\u201d the source said. When Mr. Geithner delivered the news to the President that the coin idea had been scrapped, according to the source, \u201cto say that things got ugly would be a massive understatement.\u201d The coin fiasco behind him, Mr. Obama has now apparently learned his lesson, the source said: \u201cIf this coin idea ever comes up again, he\u2019s going to make Biden pose for it.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VCHARLESTON, S.C. (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Stung by defeat in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is considering a bold strategy to reboot his Presidential campaign: engaging in a high-profile extramarital affair. At a press conference in Charleston, Mr. Romney confirmed that he was consulting with senior advisers about the best way to proceed with an inappropriate relationship. \u201cRepublican voters have sent the message that they want to vote for an adulterous scumbag, and I have heard them loud and clear,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise that I will engage in a world-class extramarital affair that will make all of us proud again.\u201d         According to one senior adviser, the Romney campaign was already holding focus groups and conducting special polling to determine the best person with whom Mr. Romney should conduct his extracurricular dalliance. And, in a sign that Mr. Romney is taking precipitous action to find an object for his adulterous intentions, today his campaign launched a new dating site, SexyTimeWithMitt.com. But according to one female visitor to the site, Mr. Romney\u2019s nascent career as a would-be lothario is still very much a work in progress: \u201cHe listed his status as \u2018It\u2019s complicated,\u2019 but then I read a little further and realized he was talking about his taxes.\u201d Elsewhere, an exultant Newt Gingrich made the following victory statement: \u201cI\u2019ve left Mitt Romney behind faster than a woman with cancer.\u201d

VCRAWFORD, TEXAS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Just hours after the United States Senate voted to reverse key provisions of the Patriot Act, former President George W. Bush said that he regretted that the law had been partially repealed before he ever got a chance to read it. \u201cAt the time when it was being passed and whatnot, people around the White House were saying it was a really good law,\u201d Bush said at his ranch in Crawford, Texas. \u201cI remember saying to myself, \u2018I really need to read that.\u2019 \u201c Bush said that right after he signed the Patriot Act into law, \u201cI wrote on a little Post-It note, \u2018READ PATRIOT ACT.\u2019 So it was definitely something I was meaning to do. But I guess it was one of those things I never did get around to.\u201d Now that the law has been partially reversed, Bush said, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a little late in the game to start reading it,\u201d but he indicated that he still \u201cmight check it out just to see what all the fuss was about.\u201d \u201cI think they have it down at my Presidential library, so maybe one of these days I\u2019ll set aside some time and read it,\u201d he said, before adding, \u201cHa ha, who am I kidding?

VAUSTIN (The Borowitz Report) \u2014 N.S.A. leaker Edward Snowden surprised a standing-room-only crowd at this year\u2019s SXSW by performing an impromptu set of four songs from his new CD, which was released online today. The audience, which had gathered to hear Mr. Snowden answer questions about the N.S.A. and government surveillance, was instead treated to the first-ever live performance of songs from Mr. Snowden\u2019s album, simply titled \u201cEdward.\u201d         \u201cI made this music for you, my fans,\u201d Mr. Snowden said, adding that he doesn\u2019t \u201ccare about the haters.\u201d Listeners were divided about the quality of the eclectic four-song set, which spanned musical styles from alt-country to dubstep. Music critic Tracy Klugian said, \u201cSnowden is the most exciting new artist to come out of SXSW in a long time. It reminded me of the first time I heard Conor Oberst.\u201d  She acknowledged that not every song worked. \u201cObviously, the duet with Kesha was a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I give him credit for trying.\u201d Music journalist Harland Dorrinson was less impressed. \u201cSnowden said it was new music, but I didn\u2019t hear anything new,\u201d he said. \u201cIn addition to N.S.A. documents, it sounds like he\u2019s been downloading a lot of Arcade Fire.\u201d After performing the four songs, Mr. Snowden disappointed some in the audience by refusing to talk about government surveillance. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m proud of the whistle-blowing I did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut today I just want to talk about my music.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

V TO: Jill Abramson, Executive Editor, the New York Times  FROM: Vladimir Putin    Dear Jill,   Thanks for your kind words about my Op-Ed in today\u2019s Times. I\u2019ve been checking your Web site every five minutes and I see it\u2019s the second most popular story, right after the Science Times article about middle-aged men and estrogen.   Since my writing seems to be such a big hit with your readers, I thought I\u2019d submit a \u201cModern Love.\u201d Let me know what you think! :)   Yours,  Vlad    Modern Love   by Vladimir V. Putin   They say love is like a polar bear. If you want to take it in your arms and hug it, first you must be sure that it is properly drugged. Or perhaps love is like a tiger. If it escapes from the zoo and starts charging at you, you must shoot it with a tranquilizer dart. Whether it is a polar bear or a tiger, though, one thing is true: you must make love drop to the ground, preferably with some kind of drug, or it will maul you to death and eat you.           I was lonely, vulnerable. I had just come off a relationship that had seemed so promising, but now she was far away, in Siberia. It is true that I had sent her there, but the fact remained: I was alone.    Did I mention that love is like Siberia? I should have, because love can be quite cold sometimes. And it also can seem very far away, which Siberia is. (Unless you are in Siberia yourself.)   So there I was, lonely and vulnerable, the tranquilized polar bear of my heart lying in an unconscious white furry heap at my feet.   And that\u2019s when I saw her. On TV.   I had never seen such a beautiful face, such a lithe and lissome frame. I had never seen such a delicate and precious creature as this, and I have hang-glided with endangered cranes.   I summoned my houseboy, Dmitri, who joined me in front of the TV. We watched in silent wonder for a minute or so, and then I asked him, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d   \u201cI believe in America that is called \u2018twerking.\u2019\u2009\u201d   \u201cI must have her.\u201d   Days passed. With Dmitri\u2019s aid I sought her out. We tried Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I sent her a Vine video of me kickboxing a tranquilized shark. No response.   I went to St. Petersburg for the G20. All around me, people were speaking of Syria, but all I could think about was my goddess with the foot-long tongue.   Love is like a flock of endangered cranes. It will take you soaring into the clouds, but if you are not careful it will send you hang-gliding into the side of a mountain, your brains falling to the earth in tiny gray jelly bits.   I excused myself from the G20, saying that I was trying to solve the crisis in Syria. In actuality, I was calling Dmitri to see if she had Vined me back.   \u201cHave you heard anything from her?\u201d I asked.   \u201cNo, but I have some \u2026 discouraging news. From TMZ.\u201d   \u201cTMZ? What is TMZ?\u201d   \u201cIt is like KGB. They seem to have information on everyone.\u201d   \u201cWell?\u201d   \u201cIt seems that she has a boyfriend.  Someone named Liam.\u201d   I put down the phone and looked out the window, at the gray skies of St. Petersburg. My heart suddenly felt like frozen tundra, and my love, a drugged polar bear, was about to fall to that tundra with the bear-like thud that bears make when they fall down suddenly. It was as if all the endangered cranes had suddenly tumbled from the sky, shot down by the antiballistic missiles of cruel fate. Love was a lot of things, it seemed to me, and all of them were pretty bad.   But then it occurred to me: a love such as the one I had for the one who twerked so majestically might come around only once in a lifetime. Who was I to give up on such a love? Who was this Liam to stand in my way?   I picked up the phone again and spoke to Dmitri.   \u201cI want Liam shot with a tranquilizer dart.\u201d   I put down the phone. Love is a lot of things, I have learned\u2014bears, tigers, cranes\u2014but why try to define it? When all is said and done, love means shooting at something and making it fall down. That, I have learned, is the most modern love of all.  Photograph by Oleg Popov/Reuters.

In signing an executive order for the puzzles, which range in difficulty from medium to advanced, the President laid out an ambitious plan to complete as many as thirty of them a day, for a total of ten thousand by the time he leaves the White House, in January, 2017.  The President said that he hoped that Republicans in Congress would support his plan for the puzzles, but added, \u201cI don\u2019t need their support.

The British monarch\u2019s brutal evisceration of Gov. Christie stunned observers, who did not know that she was such a close follower of his gay-marriage stance.         \u201cI don\u2019t like to badmouth people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m the head of a monarchy that began in the ninth century, and I\u2019m apparently  more modern than Chris Christie.\u201d After shocking observers with her opening salvo, she continued to tear Gov. Christie to shreds. \u201cLook, I know he has to appeal to the crazy right wingers in his party,\u201d she added. \u201cBut the fact is, he\u2019s not as forward-thinking as an eighty-seven-year-old lady who wears a crown on her head. It\u2019s pathetic.\u201d Asked if she had advice for Gov. Christie, the British monarch said, bluntly, \u201cJust sign the damn bill, Chris.\u201d Responding to a reporter\u2019s question about the upcoming royal birth, Elizabeth replied, \u201cTell you the truth?

Biden took pride in announcing that he had sent both messages from his official government e-mail address, adding, \u201cI have nothing to hide.\u201d  Minutes after the e-mails were released, the media pored over the treasure trove of materials, which offer a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into Biden\u2019s tenure as Vice-President. The first e-mail, written to President Obama in December of 2009, asks about the time and place of the White House holiday party. The second and last e-mail, written in May of last year, asks the President, \u201cIs our Internet slow today? I\u2019m trying to watch something,\u201d followed by a frowny-face emoticon. According to Biden\u2019s records, the President did not respond to either e-mail. Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

But I want to reassure the people of New Jersey that I am working very hard on this.\u201d   The Governor said he understood that \u201cthings don\u2019t look very good for me right now,\u201d but he urged the public against rushing to judgment, adding, \u201cI will get back to you with a well-crafted and plausible story as soon as possible.\u201d  Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In what has become a tradition in the nation\u2019s capital, the United States Congress on Monday notched the third anniversary of doing nothing in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. As on the first and second anniversaries of the tragedy, lawmakers took up no new measures to prevent future mass shootings in the United States, and instead chose to mark Newtown\u2019s third anniversary with a day of inaction. In that respect, the third anniversary of Newtown resembles the thousand-plus days that came before it, during which Congress took no action on guns except to periodically vote down expanded background checks. Interestingly, during this same period of time, many of these legislators were able to sleep at night, sources say. According to one congressional staffer, Harland Dorrinson, marking the anniversary of Newtown by doing nothing about guns is a tradition that is unlikely to change in the halls of Congress anytime soon. \u201cThis should be a day of prayer and quiet reflection,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should not be a day of doing something to make things better.\u201d

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney dropped by the Borowitz Report today and gave what some are calling his most candid interview ever: Q: What do you see as the biggest challenge of your campaign going forward? A: Well, I suppose the biggest challenge would be the same one I\u2019ve faced all my life: that no one likes me. But as I\u2019ve found in the past, money usually takes care of that.  Q: What do you need to do to persuade the right wing of your party that you\u2019re one of them?         A: Well, first and foremost, I have to do a better job of convincing them that I believe in the crazy things they do. The problem is, the media keeps emphasizing aspects of my résumé that make me sound sane, like when I gave people in Massachusetts health care. Talk about something I\u2019d like to have a Mulligan on! Now, there\u2019s stuff in my biography that would help me with the Republican base\u2014like the time in prep school when I pinned that gay boy to the ground and cut his hair off\u2014but that gets little if any coverage. This is a clear case of media bias, and I wish it would stop. Q: How are you working to change the perception that you\u2019re sane? A: Well, obviously, by saying stuff that makes me sound like I\u2019m off my rocker. Sheldon Adelson has been super helpful with this. If I could just channel that guy, I\u2019d be ready for the booby hatch! I mean, you want to talk about a few bricks shy of a load. [Makes circular motion by the side of his head.] Anyway, he\u2019s given me some of my best lines for my stump speech. Like the one about how on Day One I\u2019m going to move Obamacare and Planned Parenthood to Iran and then bomb the hell out of all three. That\u2019s pure Sheldon. Q: Speaking of your stump speech, recently you\u2019ve been talking about how President Obama has fostered a \u201cculture of dependency.\u201d What\u2019s the impetus behind that? A: Oh, that\u2019s to appeal to voters who don\u2019t like black people. I thought that was obvious! Laughing Out Loud. Well, I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I have time for. I have to take some of the old Bain gang out for dinner and make sure we \u201ckeep our stories straight\u201d about when I worked there.

The academics, led by Professor Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, published their conclusion after their research definitively found that the bar had finally dropped to its lowest possible position. \u201cFor those who thought the bar still had room to be lowered, our findings resoundingly contradict that assumption,\u201d Logsdon said. \u201cThe bar is now essentially flush with the ground.\u201d Logsdon acknowledged that he and his fellow scholars have come under fire in the past for claiming that the bar could not be further lowered, specifically when they issued a paper to that effect after the selection of the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee in 2008. \u201cWe got that one wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly, the bar still had a way to go.\u201d Now that the issue of whether the bar can be further lowered has been settled, Logsdon and his colleagues plan to examine the question of whether there is anything left to scrape at the bottom of the barrel. \u201cOur findings are preliminary, but it appears that the answer is no,\u201d he said.

(The Borowitz Report) \u2014 In a positive development for the U.S.-led campaign of air strikes in Syria, a new poll indicates strong, broad-based support for the mission among people who have yet to read a news article about Syria. According to the poll, released on Tuesday, the bombing campaign got a thumbs-up from people who had no information about Syria\u2019s civil war, including its duration, the parties involved, and what a Sunni is.  Additionally, the air strikes garnered enthusiastic support from people who could not correctly identify the President of Syria, tell what the acronym ISIS stands for, or locate Syria on a map. According to pollster Davis Logsdon, who supervised the survey for the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, the poll numbers augur well for the mission going forward. \u201cPeople who have not read a single article about Syria are a key constituency because they represent an overwhelming majority of Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you asked the follow-up question of whether they intended to read an article about Syria in the future, their answer was a resounding no.\u201d According to Logsdon, the bombing campaign also earned high marks from another important group, Americans who think that they maybe read a news headline about Syria but did not click on it.

Don\u2019t mess it up at the last minute by accomplishing something.\u201d So with the record for worst Congress seemingly in the bag\u2014\u201cI can cross that off my bucket list,\u201d he says\u2014what does John Boehner do for an encore?   \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to make next year\u2019s Congress even worse,\u201d he says, pouring himself another tall one. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be fun trying.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

V WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Attempting to quell criticism of his proposal for a limited military mission in Syria, President Obama floated a more modest strategy today, saying that any U.S. action in Syria would have \u201cno objective whatsoever.\u201d   \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d he said in an interview on CNN. \u201cOur goal will not be to effect régime change, or alter the balance of power in Syria, or bring the civil war there to an end. We will simply do something random there for one or two days and then leave.\u201d           \u201cI want to reassure our allies and the people of Syria that what we are about to undertake, if we undertake it at all, will have no purpose or goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is consistent with U.S. foreign policy of the past.\u201d   While Mr. Obama clearly hoped that his proposal of a brief and pointless intervention in Syria would reassure the international community, it immediately drew howls of protest from U.S. allies, who argued that two days was too open-ended a timeframe for such a mission.   That criticism led White House spokesman Jay Carney to brief reporters later in the day, arguing that the President was willing to scale down the U.S. mission to \u201ctwenty-four hours, thirty-six tops.\u201d   \u201cIt may take twenty-four hours, but it could also take twelve,\u201d Mr. Carney said.    \u201cMaybe we get in there, take a look around, and get out right away. But however long it takes, one thing will not change: this mission will have no point. The President is resolute about that.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VDENVER (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Millions of Americans lost consciousness on Wednesday night between the hours of 9 and 10:30 P.M. E.T., according to widespread anecdotal reports from coast to coast.         The sudden epidemic of sleepiness prevented voters from watching more than a minute or two of the first Presidential debate between former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama, which the few observers who remained awake have called the most tedious in American history. Moderator Jim Lehrer\u2019s opening instruction to the audience that they remain silent proved unnecessary, since within minutes most of them sat with their heads tipped forward, drool visibly dangling from their mouths. Mr. Obama began the debate with a high-risk tactic that seemed designed to alienate huge swaths of the country\u2014the use of math and facts\u2014but ultimately his words seemed unlikely to turn off many viewers, who were soon off on their journey to dreamland.

VRALEIGH (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Delivering her closing argument of the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton has replaced her campaign slogan, \u201cStronger Together,\u201d with a new one, \u201cWon\u2019t Blow Up Planet.\u201d According to Clinton-campaign sources, the new slogan is designed to appeal to suburban women, a group of voters that has historically opposed blowing up the planet. Clinton launched the slogan at a campaign appearance in Raleigh, North Carolina, where she told supporters, \u201cOn Day One of my Administration, I will work for you. I will fight for you. And I will not blow up the planet.\u201d But, even as Clinton spoke, the slogan came under fire from Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who said that it reflected \u201cthe failed policies of the past.\u201d \u201cThe American people have just had eight years of a President who didn\u2019t blow up the planet,\u201d Conway said. \u201cDonald Trump is offering something different.\u201d

VNEW HAMPSHIRE (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a new effort to settle nagging questions about his finances, Republican Presidential pick Mitt Romney today told reporters that his dog ate his tax returns and also served as C.E.O. of Bain Capital from 1999 to 2002. Mr. Romney\u2019s narrative about the Irish setter Seamus Romney, shared with reporters during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, was perhaps the most emotional invocation of a pet by a politician since Richard M. Nixon\u2019s famed Checkers speech of 1952. \u201cSeamus was more than a dog,\u201d Mr. Romney said, his voice beginning to quaver. \u201cAs C.E.O. of Bain, he was a job creator.\u201d But Mr. Romney\u2019s revelations about his dog\u2019s career in private equity may have raised more questions than it answered, as a spokesperson for People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) questioned the G.O.P. candidate\u2019s latest version of events.         \u201cIf we are to believe Mitt Romney, in 2002 while Seamus was supposedly running Bain Capital he would have been at least 140 years old [in dog years],\u201d said PETA\u2019s Carol Foyler. \u201cThis shaggy-dog story represents Mitt Romney\u2019s latest act of animal cruelty.\u201d Minutes after PETA\u2019s response, Mr. Romney released an amended statement, saying that Seamus Romney had served as C.E.O. of Bain \u201cposthumously.\u201d It was a quieter day for Mr. Romney\u2019s wife Ann, who, after her \u201cyou people\u201d gaffe on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d yesterday, was seen riding home on the roof of Mr. Romney\u2019s car.

V BAGHDAD (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a development that offers a faint glimmer of hope for Iraq, both Sunnis and Shiites are finding common ground in the view that former Vice-President Dick Cheney seriously needs to shut up.   In the days following the publication, this week, of a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece about Iraq that Cheney wrote with his daughter Liz, hatred of the former Vice-President has, to the surprise of many, become the first thing that Sunnis and Shiites have agreed upon in centuries.           Iraqi observers in recent days have reported seeing both Sunnis and Shiites reading the Cheneys\u2019 op-ed then tearing it to shreds in a rage.   \u201cCheney is an ass!\u201d a Sunni merchant reportedly exclaimed in a Baghdad market on Thursday, to the resounding cheers of several Shiites nearby.   \u201cHistorically, it\u2019s been challenging to find anything that Sunnis and Shiites agree on,\u201d said Sabah al-Alousi, a history professor at the University of Baghdad. \u201cThat\u2019s why their apparent consensus that Dick Cheney needs to shut the hell up is so significant.\u201d   Visiting Baghdad on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the joint Sunni-Shiite calls for Dick Cheney to shut his pie hole were a cause for optimism.   \u201cIf Dick Cheney winds up being the one thing that brings Sunnis and Shiites together, the United States owes him a debt of thanks,\u201d he said, adding that the two sects\u2019 view of the former Vice-President was also shared by the Kurds.

That\u2019s why this moment is such a valuable wake-up call.\u201d         Dr. Logsdon says that the key to preventing post-gala violence is \u201cfirst understanding its root causes.\u201d \u201cGalas are very stressful situations,\u201d he says. \u201cAttendees have spent thousands on gowns and spa treatments, and tens of thousands more on silent-auction items. All of that pressure has to go somewhere. More often than not, it erupts into violence.\u201d He credits the national media, especially TMZ, for finally shining a light on one of the nation\u2019s biggest problems. \u201cAs regrettable as this incident was, if it results in people talking seriously about post-gala violence, it will all have been worth it,\u201d he says.

Cruz (R-Texas) announced his candidacy two weeks ago with the words \u201cGod isn\u2019t done with America yet,\u201d a substantial number of Americans \u201chave begun seriously questioning the existence of God,\u201d said Carol Foyler, the executive director of the American Society of Atheists.  \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Foyler said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting calls from people who are curious about atheism for the first time in their lives. And when we ask them what got them thinking about it, they all say the same thing: \u2018I just heard Ted Cruz talk.\u2019 \u201c Foyler said that her group often notices a surge in atheism after natural disasters or other traumatic events that rattle people\u2019s faith, but, she added, \u201cWe\u2019ve never seen anything like Ted Cruz.\u201d After Cruz aired an Easter weekend campaign ad in which he spoke of the transformative power of Christ, Foyler said, \u201cOur phones were ringing off the hook.\u201d \u201cAs an atheist, I naturally don\u2019t believe in the power of Christ to transform people,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I definitely believe in the power of Ted Cruz to transform people into atheists.\u201d Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist and outspoken atheist, said that Cruz\u2019s ability to convert millions to atheism was \u201cnothing short of extraordinary.\u201d \u201cTed Cruz has created more atheists in two weeks than I have in decades,\u201d Dawkins said.

This is an important step to free them from that unfair and heinous obligation.\u201d         Justice Scalia added that the Voting Rights Act had \u201cthrust upon the shoulders of millions of Americans the terrible and unwanted burden of exercising their rights in a democracy.\u201d \u201cMany of them have been forced to drive to polling places, wait in line, and then cast their vote because of the oppressive requirements of this Act,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is our honor and duty to free them from those hardships.\u201d In conclusion, Justice Scalia wrote, \u201cOur message today to the American people is simple: we are voting so you won\u2019t have to.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

In a hypothetical matchup between a Clinton who has been rendered completely unconscious and a fully sentient Trump, voters chose an inert Clinton over an ambulatory Trump by a margin of nine percentage points. A spokesperson for the Clinton campaign hailed the findings. \u201cWe have every reason to believe that Hillary Clinton will be a fully conscious President,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cBut even if she is not, she is still the far better choice.\u201d The same poll revealed that a broad majority of voters found an unconscious Donald Trump more fit to be President than a conscious one.

It has been an up-and-down convention for Mr. Romney, who was largely ignored at Tea Party rallies early in the week but later picked up a key endorsement from his wife. Tonight, however, was a time to reflect, as he put it, \u201con money well spent.\u201d \u201cOur opponents say that America is in decline, that it is no longer number one,\u201d he said. \u201cI say our democracy is the best that money can buy.\u201d Mr. Romney braided his speech with the theme of \u201cI bought it,\u201d reminding his audience that in order to take the White House, \u201cI have millions to go before I sleep.\u201d He made an emotional appeal to a group he called \u201cthe single-issue billionaires,\u201d imploring them, \u201cLet me know what you want. Eliminate the E.P.A.? Bomb Iran? Mitt Romney is open for business.\u201d The audience roared its approval. Mr. Romney made one reference to his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.): \u201cDon\u2019t let his crazy rock-and-roll playlist fool you. He\u2019s serious about the important things: cutting taxes for the rich and ending Planned Parenthood.\u201d Ultimately, he ended his speech with a rousing call to arms that brought the Republican audience to its feet: \u201cThe road to the White House will be hard, and strewn with challenges.

VMINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014With U.S. Presidential elections now costing more than five billion dollars, there must be a cheaper way to find the worst people in the country, experts believe. According to Davis Logsdon, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, the United States could use current technology to find the nation\u2019s most reprehensible people at a fraction of the five-billion-dollar price tag. \u201cAny search for the worst people in the country should logically begin one place: on Twitter,\u201d said Logsdon, who recommends scouring the social network for users who consistently show signs of narcissistic-personality disorder, poor impulse control, and other traits common to odious people. Once a comprehensive list of those Twitter users is compiled, Logsdon said, it could be cross-referenced with a database containing the names of people who have presided over spectacular business failures, have been the target of multiple ethics probes, or are currently under indictment for a broad array of criminal offenses. \u201cAfter we crunch the numbers and find the twelve or so worst people in our database, we could then put them on television to demonstrate just how awful they are as people,\u201d said Logsdon, who noted that that part of the current system \u201cworks very well.\u201d All in all, Logsdon believes that his method for finding the nation\u2019s worst people would cost practically nothing, leaving five billion dollars left over to help rebuild the nation\u2019s schools, roads, and other crumbling infrastructure. The political scientist expects to encounter significant resistance to his proposal, however. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a new system finding worse people than our current one does,\u201d he admitted.

(The Borowitz Report)\u2014Saying it was \u201chigh time to take action against the number one cause of violence in America,\u201d the National Rifle Association issued a statement today urging a sweeping ban on movies.   Tracy Klugian, an official spokesperson for the gun-lobbying organization, said that the N.R.A. had taken this extraordinary step because it \u201ccould not stand idly by and watch movies tear apart the fabric of our civil society.\u201d   To that end, Mr. Klugian said, the N.R.A. would use money from its PAC, the N.R.A. Political Victory Fund, to support politicians who favored a ban on filmed entertainment.   In the hours after the N.R.A.\u2019s announcement, politicians on both sides of the aisle were quick to applaud the group for identifying what it called \u201ca long overdue need for movie control.\u201d           \u201cIt is time for us to stop the madness,\u201d said Speaker of the House John Boehner. \u201cAs a first step, I am proposing legislation that would impose a two-year waiting period and background check before one is allowed to see a Hollywood release.\u201d   Minutes later, the White House said that the Speaker\u2019s proposal was \u201ca good first step, but does not go far enough,\u201d arguing that Congress had to \u201ctake a hard look at whether superhero costumes and masks should continue to be legal.\u201d   All in all, the N.R.A.\u2019s Klugian said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the organization\u2019s call for new legislation would be heeded \u201cbecause our message finally seems to be getting through: Guns don\u2019t kill people.

The summit, which Putin has set for June in Sochi, is expected to be attended by the G-1 member nation Russia.         Putin pronounced himself delighted by Russia\u2019s attendance, telling reporters, \u201cIt is an auspicious start for the G-1 to have the participation of all its member nations.\u201d In addition to what he called \u201ca free exchange of ideas on issues of importance to the G-1,\u201d the summit is expected to elect the first president of the G-1, a position for which Putin is widely considered the frontrunner. Putin denied he was a candidate for the post, but added, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor just to be in the mix.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

The tape, including such luminaries as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, Texas senator Ted Cruz, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, and New Jersey governor Chris Christie, appeared briefly on major news Web sites before an avalanche of viewer revulsion demanded it be taken down. According to Carol Foyler, a viewer who happened to catch the tape during its brief appearance on the CNN Web site, the video contained images \u201cI may never be able to get out of my mind.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that these people would participate in such a thing,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept maybe Santorum.\u201d A spokesman for Rick Perry defended the former Texas governor\u2019s appearance on the tape. \u201cIt changed the conversation, at least for a minute or two,\u201d the spokesman said.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report) \u2013 Today, American International Group (A.I.G.) issued the following letter to American taxpayers. Dear American Taxpayers: In 2008, you paid for a bailout of A.I.G. totalling $182 billion. Today, we are writing to tell you that we\u2019re thinking of suing you.  When we made this decision, we knew we were in for some rough treatment from the media. We\u2019ve been called everything from soulless bloodsuckers to Satan\u2019s scabrous handmaidens, and worse. At A.I.G., though, we have a different name for ourselves: true American heroes.         You see, by suing the same people who bailed out our asses just five years ago, we are standing up for one of the most precious American rights of all: the right to sue someone who has just saved your life. Let\u2019s say that you\u2019re trapped in a burning building and a fireman pulls you out to safety. Once you\u2019re out of the fire, though, you notice that the fireman carelessly ripped the lapel of your Armani jacket. Shouldn\u2019t you be able to sue the fireman for the full cost of its replacement? Or let\u2019s say you\u2019re drowning in the ocean. A lifeguard dives in, pulls you back onto the shore, and administers mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Aren\u2019t you entitled to take appropriate action\u2014i.e., sue him for sexual harassment? By suing you, we are standing up for the right of every other American who might, through no fault of his own, have his life saved and want to sue the person who saved him for millions of dollars. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking for your help today. Lawsuits aren\u2019t cheap. They require highly paid lawyers, who rack up millions in legal fees, not to mention first-class airfare, hotels, and sumptuous gourmet meals\u2014hardly the kind of expense that we at A.I.G. can afford. That\u2019s why we\u2019d like you to pay for it. You may think we\u2019re expecting a lot, asking you for the money necessary for us to sue you. But, remember, there\u2019s a bigger principle at stake, and someday, if you\u2019re pulled from a burning building or an ocean, you\u2019ll be glad you stood with us today. Oh, and as for our ad campaign, \u201cThank you, America\u201d? We\u2019re sticking with that, just changing the first word. See you in court, Your friends at A.I.G.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In what is being hailed as a productive closed-door meeting between two leaders of the Republican Party, Donald J. Trump promised House Speaker Paul Ryan on Thursday that he would try to sound slightly less like the former German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. Speaking to reporters at the U.S. Capitol after the meeting, the presumptive G.O.P. nominee said that Ryan had expressed concern that so many of the billionaire\u2019s public utterances were reminiscent of the Third Reich. \u201cPaul basically said, \u2018Can you help me out here? Can you not sound like Hitler all the time?\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Paul, I can absolutely do that for you.\u2019\u201d As an example, Trump said, \u201cInstead of saying I am going to round up people based on their religion, I\u2019ll say that\u2019s just a suggestion. Just like that, I\u2019m fifty per cent less Hitlerish.\u201d Trump acknowledged that the challenge for him will be to sound somewhat less like Hitler to please congressional Republicans while still sounding enough like Hitler to avoid alienating his key constituencies of Nazis and white supremacists. \u201cFiguring out just how much like Hitler I\u2019m going to be at any given time is the kind of thing I\u2019ve always been fantastic at,\u201d he said.

Adding to their disbelief were reports that the accomplishment came as the result of collaboration between a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in Congress.

While Americans are divided about the merits of the specific charges levelled against Perry, there is near-unanimous agreement that imprisoning politicians for ninety-nine years is an idea worth exploring further, a poll released on Monday indicates. According to the poll, eighty-seven per cent of voters from both parties agreed that sending politicians to prison for such a lengthy period would \u201csolve a lot of problems\u201d and \u201cmake the country safer.\u201d Additionally, when asked to name one politician they would like to see incarcerated for ninety-nine years, voters easily rattled off a dozen or more such candidates, with some voters naming as many as fifty. Finally, when informed that imprisoning politicians for ninety-nine years might lead to overcrowding that would require the construction of costly new prisons, eighty-three per cent agreed with the statement, \u201cMoney is no object.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VCLEVELAND (The Borowitz Report) \u2013 The Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 star LeBron James said that he would do everything in his power to win an N.B.A. title after the rest of his team vanished into a mysterious vortex shortly after Game 2 on Sunday night. The vortex, which swallowed up Timofey Mozgov, Matthew Dellavedova, J. R. Smith, and the rest of the Cavs\u2019 roster while the team was en route from Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena to their hotel, was \u201cjust one more challenge we have to deal with,\u201d James told reporters. \u201cIn a perfect world, it would be nice to have four other players out there on the court with me,\u201d James said. \u201cBut if the guys have been somehow transported to an alternate dimension or whatever, that just means we\u2019ll have to find another way to win.\u201d Asked whether winning an N.B.A. title after the rest of his team inexplicably dematerialized would cement his legacy, James brushed off the question. \u201cI don\u2019t think about that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just focussing on getting the ball to myself.\u201d Showing his resolve to win a title, James said, \u201cI owe it to the city of Cleveland. I owe it to my team\u2014wherever they may be.\u201d Las Vegas oddsmakers weighed in on the sudden absence of everyone on the Cavaliers except James, calling Cleveland a slight favorite for Game 3 due to home-court advantage. The Cavaliers\u2019 coach, David Blatt, said that he felt \u201cconfident\u201d fielding a team consisting of only LeBron for Game 3, and noted that the mysterious disappearance of the rest of the team would open up significant cap space for the 2015-16 season.

Nice job.\u201d   Sensing that his remarks were not going over as well as intended, Mr. Romney improvised: \u201cNo, really. Incredible building job you did.

Eric Cantor to represent them in the United States Congress. Apparently deciding that Cantor was insufficiently heartless to represent their district, Republicans turned out to the polls to elect David Brat, a man whose political views \u201cborder on sociopathy,\u201d according to exit-poll responses from voters who supported him.         During his concession speech, Rep. Cantor reflected on the mistakes that might have led to his defeat: \u201cShould I have cut more school-lunch programs for poor children? Perhaps. Should I have cast more votes to screw over disaster victims? Definitely. Should I have not said the thing about treating children of immigrants like human beings? Man, do I wish I could take that one back. Hindsight is twenty-twenty, but at the end of the day I was just too damn empathic for this district.\u201d But Rep. Cantor was gracious in defeat, offering words of congratulation to the victorious Mr. Brat. \u201cThe people of the Seventh District have spoken,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time has come to pass the torch to a new generation of asshats.\u201d When asked about the defeat of his longtime colleague in the House, Speaker John Boehner said, \u201cI will give a formal statement as soon as I can stop laughing.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

V MINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a possible setback for the Administration\u2019s controversial drone policy, a new poll conducted by the University of Minnesota shows that a broad majority of Americans are opposed to being killed by a drone strike on U.S. soil.   The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points, showed that ninety-seven per cent of those surveyed \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d with the statement, \u201cI personally do not want to be killed by a drone,\u201d with three per cent responding, \u201cDon\u2019t know/No opinion.\u201d           \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to interpret these numbers,\u201d said the University of Minnesota\u2019s Davis Logsdon, who oversaw the survey. \u201cThe idea of being killed by a drone is not playing well out there.\u201d   And while the poll numbers may not augur well for the Administration\u2019s expanding use of drones, the response was even more negative in a focus group of likely drone victims. One member of that group, a forty-three-year-old male from St. Paul, complained that \u201cit doesn\u2019t even seem like the government is trying to come up with alternatives to killing us with drones.\u201d   \u201cIt seems like they could figure out some kind of system where instead of just being killed by a drone, people could maybe present evidence to see if they\u2019re guilty or not,\u201d he said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney tried to make the best of the poll results, telling reporters, \u201cLook, people are afraid of getting killed by a drone.  We get that.

Cantor\u2019s comments drew a strong rebuke from Darrell Issa (R-California), who has spearheaded the investigation into Benghazi: \u201cQuite frankly, we have all the time in the world to blow repealing Obamacare. The moment to waste our time investigating Benghazi is now.\u201d Noting that previous attempts to repeal Obamacare had cost the taxpayers approximately fifty million dollars, Issa said, \u201cI think we\u2019re entitled to spend at least that much, if not more, investigating Benghazi again and again and again.\u201d   But even as the debate raged over whether Obamacare or Benghazi was more worthy of Congress\u2019 wasted time, House Speaker John Boehner offered a third point of view: \u201cPersonally, I think the time we\u2019re wasting on Benghazi and Obamacare could be better spent blocking progress on guns and immigration.\u201d  Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

According to the campaign, Pence had asked to stop at a McDonald\u2019s in rural Virginia so that he could use the bathroom, but aides grew concerned when the governor failed to reappear after twenty minutes. After determining that Pence had given them the slip, Trump staffers fanned out across the Virginia backcountry, where the governor was believed to have fled. News that Pence had vanished touched off a panic in Indiana, where residents feared that he might return to resume his political career. After forty-five minutes of searching, however, campaign officials located a bedraggled and dazed Pence walking along Virginia State Route 287, where the Republican Vice-Presidential nominee was attempting unsuccessfully to hitch a ride. A confrontation that Trump aides characterized as \u201ctense\u201d ensued, after which a sobbing Pence returned to the bus. In the aftermath of Pence\u2019s disappearance, Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s press secretary, attempted to downplay the severity of the incident. \u201cThis is the kind of thing that happens in the course of a long and demanding campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving said that, we\u2019re grateful to have Mike Pence back with us, and we won\u2019t let him get away again.\u201d Reportedly, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie offered to fill in for Pence in the event that he became unable to fulfill his duties.

In announcing the decision, the White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that the cutback in drone service was \u201cbound to be controversial.\u201d \u201cIn the United States, we\u2019ve always prided ourselves on our ability to target our citizens with drone strikes, Monday through Saturday, regardless of the weather,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that losing Saturday drone service is going to take some getting used to.\u201d           But the move to cut back drone service drew sharp criticism from a longtime defender of the program, the former Vice-President Dick Cheney. \u201cLike most Americans, I thought I\u2019d never see the day when drones just up and take Saturdays off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would never be happening if I were still President.\u201d   As if to silence critics, Mr. Carney assured reporters that drones could \u201cstill get the job done\u201d Monday through Friday, and reminded U.S. citizens to update the government on any change of address so the drones would know where to reach them.

Speaking at the White House before this week\u2019s NATO summit, a visibly furious Obama said that Putin\u2019s new practice of letting his calls go straight to voice mail \u201champers our ability to discuss the future of Ukraine and other important issues going forward.\u201d Having left dozens of voice mails for the Russian President, Obama said that he tried to reach him via e-mail on Monday night but received an out-of-office auto reply. \u201cGiven what he has been up to in Ukraine over the past few weeks, I find it impossible believe he has been out of the office,\u201d Obama said. The President hinted that Putin\u2019s failure to respond to his voice mails could result in additional sanctions and signaled that he did not intend to call the Russian President again. \u201cI have left my last voice mail for him,\u201d he said, adding that the last time he called Putin his mailbox was full.

VAUSTIN, Tex.  (The Borowitz Report)\u2014With an eye toward a Presidential run in 2016, Rick Perry, the Texas governor, is hoping that a two-pronged strategy of wearing glasses and not speaking will make him appear smarter to voters, aides to the Governor confirmed today. \u201cAfter the 2012 Republican primary, we knew that we needed to solve what we called the Governor\u2019s smartness problem,\u201d said Harland Dorrinson, an aide to Perry. \u201cThe fix that we came up with was glasses, but, as it turned out, that was only half the solution.\u201d         After outfitting Perry with designer eyewear, aides sent him on the road to reintroduce himself to voters, but the response, Mr. Dorrinson said, was underwhelming: \u201cThe problem was, he was still talking.\u201d A round of focus groups convinced aides that only through a combination of wearing glasses and not emitting any sounds could Perry overcome voters\u2019 initial impressions of him. At a recent political stop in San Antonio, the newly minted Governor Perry was on display, wearing his glasses and gesticulating expressively while saying nothing for thirty minutes. \u201cOur focus groups show people no longer know what Rick Perry is thinking,\u201d said Mr. Dorrinson. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge improvement.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

Roth\u2019s retirement from sandwich eating, announced in an interview with a Dutch literary magazine, came as a surprise to the worlds of publishing and sandwiches.           In the interview, Roth attempted to soft-pedal the reasons behind his startling decision, saying only, \u201cI had my first sandwich when I was three or four. That\u2019s almost eighty years ago. That\u2019s a lot of sandwiches.\u201d   The response to Mr. Roth\u2019s renunciation of sandwiches was skeptical, with some readers of the interview questioning whether the acclaimed novelist had not left the door open a crack to sandwiches in his future.   When asked by his Dutch interviewer if he had sworn off deli meats, Roth said, \u201cI could see a situation at a buffet where they\u2019d have those mini slices of rye bread, and I\u2019d make an open-faced thingy with roast beef and maybe a pickle or whatnot. But that\u2019s not the same thing as a sandwich.\u201d   As if to quell any misunderstanding, on Tuesday afternoon Roth issued the following statement through his publisher: \u201cNot only have I had my last sandwich, I have made my final public statement about sandwiches.\u201d    Photograph by Jenny Anderson/Getty.

VSIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA (The Borowitz Report) \u2013 A thorough fact checking reveals that Wednesday night\u2019s Republican Presidential debate was four per cent fact, fact checkers reported Thursday morning. According to HonestyWatch, a Minnesota-based fact-checking organization, over the course of three hours the Republican candidates served up between eight and twelve facts, not including their names and job descriptions. While few of the facts that were dispensed during the debate related to policy matters, viewers did learn that Jeb Bush smoked pot in high school, and that Donald Trump had not yet ridiculed Rand Paul\u2019s looks, the fact checkers found. At CNN, the debate moderator, Jake Tapper, said he was proud of the role he played in keeping the evening\u2019s fact content to a minimum. \u201cWhenever I felt the candidates were straying into the issues, I tried to goad them into insulting each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t succeed every time, but all in all I feel good about the night.\u201d While Tapper might be happy with Wednesday\u2019s contest, it failed to match the benchmark set by August\u2019s Fox News debate, which came in at three per cent fact.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014With thirteen days until his scheduled return to oblivion, many Americans are unsure if they can tolerate that much additional exposure to Rudy Giuliani, a leading psychologist said on Wednesday. As millions of Americans actively count down the days until Giuliani disappears forever, thirteen more days of him \u201cseems like a lifetime,\u201d Davis Logsdon, a psychologist who has been studying the Giuliani ordeal, said. \u201cAmericans\u2019 traumatic experience of Rudy Giuliani in 2016 has gone through several phases,\u201d Logsdon said. \u201cFirst, they struggled to remember who he was. Then, once they remembered, they recoiled in horror. Finally, they began actively wishing he would go away forever. That is the phase many people find themselves in today.\u201d Even as they long for the day when Giuliani resumes his rightful place in obscurity, many Americans are experiencing feelings of anger and disbelief that he was permitted to crawl back into their consciousness to begin with, Logsdon said. \u201cOf the many inexcusable things that cable news has done this election, repeatedly subjecting Americans to Rudy Giuliani is at the top of the list,\u201d he said. \u201cThe human cost has been enormous.\u201d As they struggle to endure the final thirteen days of Rudy Giuliani, Americans should not feel isolated or alone, Logsdon said. \u201cThey need to know that there are millions of people just like them, and even more who are unsure if they can stand another thirteen days of Kellyanne Conway,\u201d he said.

With gay marriage and Obamacare effectively taken off the table, the Republicans now find themselves without a signature phony issue to disingenuously flog for the next sixteen months.

VCLEVELAND (The Borowitz Report)\u2014As preparations get under way for the first Republican Presidential debate, on Thursday night, a new poll shows that Americans are deeply concerned that the rest of the world might see it. According to the poll, there is widespread fear that, if the debate were to be viewed in foreign countries, the cost to the United States\u2019 prestige around the world would be incalculable. On a more personal level, many expressed concern that any international broadcast of the debate would greatly diminish their desire to ever travel abroad or talk to foreigners. In another measure of Americans\u2019 discomfort with Thursday\u2019s televised event, two of the TV programs they identified as being the biggest embarrassments to America, \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d and \u201cJersey Shore,\u201d still lagged far behind the debate. Those surveyed strongly agreed that the U.S. government should block the foreign transmission of the debate, or that Fox News should air an explanation of the contest beforehand, but they were at a loss as to what that explanation could possibly be. And, in a result that seemed to sum up Americans\u2019 anxiety, a broad majority agreed with the statement \u201cGod, this is so embarrassing.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VTRENTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014If Chris Christie faces prosecution for an alleged role in the so-called Bridgegate scandal, his endorsement of Donald Trump could play a crucial role in an insanity defense, legal experts believe. Harland Dorrinson, a defense attorney who has represented many politicians in high-profile criminal cases, believes that Christie\u2019s endorsement of Trump earlier this year could persuade a jury that the New Jersey Governor is \u201ccompletely incapable of rational thought.\u201d \u201cAn insanity defense is always a long shot, because the bar for insanity is set very high,\u201d Dorrinson said. \u201cHaving said that, I believe that Christie\u2019s endorsement of Trump easily meets that standard.\u201d If Christie is prosecuted, his defense team is likely to show the jury footage of Trump routinely humiliating the New Jersey Governor on the campaign trail. \u201cIt will become abundantly clear that Christie endorsed Trump and received absolutely no conceivable benefit for doing so,\u201d Dorrinson said. \u201cLegally speaking, the only word for that is insane.\u201d Additionally, Christie\u2019s lawyers can argue that he begged Trump to name him his Vice-Presidential nominee, even after it was painfully obvious that the billionaire had no intention of doing so. \u201cSeriously, that was crazy,\u201d Dorrinson said. If Christie\u2019s legal team succeeds with an insanity defense, the New Jersey Governor could avoid prison and be sent to a psychiatric facility instead, Dorrinson believes. \u201cAs long as he\u2019s being held someplace where he can do no harm, the people of New Jersey should be happy,\u201d he said.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In what historians are calling an unprecedented development in American politics, both major parties decided today to cancel the 2012 election. The decision to scrap the 2012 contest came on the heels of a new poll showing President Barack Obama with an approval rating of a hundred per cent, believed to be a record high for an American President. Mr. Obama even polled well among Republicans, with a majority of G.O.P. voters agreeing with the statement, \u201cI no longer care that he wasn\u2019t born here.\u201d The new bipartisan spirit sweeping the nation was captured well by House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio), who tearfully told reporters, \u201cThis is a great day for America \u2026 oh, leave me alone, goddamn it.\u201d         Republican Presidential hopeful Donald Trump made no official announcement, but sources said he was considering running for Prime Minister of Canada. The cancellation of the election comes in the aftermath of the death of Osama bin Laden, whose last words reportedly were, \u201cI knew I shouldn\u2019t have signed up for Foursquare.\u201d Of all the major news networks, Fox News did not report news of bin Laden\u2019s death, saying that it would air cartoons \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d In Libya, Colonel Muammar Qaddafi issued the following official statement: \u201cUh-oh.\u201d In North Korea, President Kim Jong-il said this: \u201cI have lost my last friend on Facebook.\u201d And in Wasilla, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin said this: \u201cWe must find and kill Osama bin Laden.\u201d

For that sum, the new employees will be expected to work a hundred and thirty-seven days a year, leaving them with two hundred and twenty-eight days of vacation. Some critics have blasted the federal jobs program as too expensive, noting that the workers were chosen last November in a bloated and wasteful selection process that cost the nation nearly four billion dollars. But Davis Logsdon, a University of Minnesota economics professor who specializes in labor issues, said that the program is necessary to provide work \u201cfor people who honestly cannot find employment anywhere else.\u201d \u201cExpensive as this program is, it is much better to have these people in jobs than out on the street,\u201d he said.

According to Butch Rydzewski, the Browns fan who is masterminding the relocation effort, Los Angeles is the ideal destination for the team \u201cbecause it is two thousand miles away and someplace most of us have no intention of ever visiting.\u201d In addition to relocating the team, Rydzewski said that Browns fans were putting measures in place to make sure that the team never returns. \u201cWe are lobbying the city council to demolish FirstEnergy Stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly then can the healing begin.\u201d But, even as Cleveland fans pushed forward on the relocation plan, city officials in Los Angeles were taking steps to prevent the Browns from moving there, including taking out a restraining order against quarterback Johnny Manziel.

Issa said, at such high speeds \u201cit is questionable whether this Web site is even safe for consumers to use, particularly the elderly.\u201d The California Republican said he would call for hearings this week to investigate the dangerous new velocity of healthcare.gov, telling reporters, \u201cIf anyone can slow this thing down, it\u2019s me.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

V WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, National Rifle Association C.E.O. Wayne LaPierre warned that the N.R.A. would vigorously oppose any legislation that \u201climits the sale, purchase, or ownership of politicians.\u201d   \u201cPoliticians pose no danger to the public if used correctly,\u201d said Mr. LaPierre, who claims to have over two hundred politicians in his personal collection.  \u201cEveryone hears about the bad guys in Congress. Well, the only thing that stops a bad guy with a vote is a good guy with a vote.  I\u2019m proud to be the owner of many of those guys.\u201d           Mr. LaPierre\u2019s comments drew a sharp rebuke from Carol Foyler, a politician-control advocate who has spent the past twelve years lobbying for stricter limits on the sale of politicians.   \u201cRight now, a man like Wayne LaPierre can walk right into Congress and buy any politician he wants,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no background check, no waiting period. And so hundreds of politicians are falling into the hands of people who are unstable and, quite frankly, dangerous.\u201d   In addition to limiting the sale of politicians, Ms. Foyler said, it is time for society to take a look at the \u201csheer number\u201d of politicians in the U.S.: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we would be safer if there were fewer of them.\u201d   For his part, the N.R.A. leader ended his testimony by serving notice that he would \u201cresist any attempt\u201d to take away the hundreds of elected officials he says are legally his.   As if to illustrate that point, he clutched Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) close to his chest and bellowed, \u201cFrom my cold, dead hands.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, Palin\u2019s ability to articulate her positions on issues with precision and restraint is sorely lacking among other entrants in the G.O.P. race. Additionally, voters said that the former governor\u2019s breadth of knowledge in the fields of economics, foreign affairs, and American history would place her head and shoulders above the current crop of Republican hopefuls. In the words of one voter who was surveyed, \u201cWhen I hear some of these candidates talk, I sure do miss Sarah Palin.\u201d Despite the overwhelming sense that she would contribute gravitas and intellectual rigor that have been woefully missing from the G.O.P. contest, a Palin candidacy appears unlikely, a spokesman said. \u201cGovernor Palin is very flattered by this poll, but she is concerned that being associated with this field of candidates could harm her stature,\u201d he said.

My opponents would have you believe that if I\u2019m elected, you\u2019ll be stripped of your Social Security benefits and will be scrounging for food in dumpsters with all the desperation of a feral cat. Of course, that\u2019s true. But what they don\u2019t tell you is what I\u2019d replace Social Security with: an amazing new program I like to call Perrycare. Under Perrycare, you\u2019ll receive all the food, clothing and shelter you need, and it won\u2019t cost a dime in taxes. How is that possible? Simple: you\u2019ll be praying for all those things.         As a Perrycare recipient, each week you\u2019ll receive in your e-mail box a Perrycare PrayerMail, giving you an easy-to-recite prayer for the bread, milk, cat food, or whatever else you need to survive. It\u2019s like a Groupon from God. Perrycare is more than a replacement for that infernal Ponzi scheme that has bamboozled Americans with regular monthly checks for seventy-five years. It is part of my larger plan to return prayer to its rightful place in American life. I get down on my knees every night and I promise you, if I am elected your President, I will bring this entire country to its knees. I expect that some of my opponents will laugh at my plan, especially that lawn gnome Ron Paul and Michele (Crazy Eyes) Bachmann. Fine, let them laugh! Laughter is the best medicine. And if I am elected, there will be no other medicine. That brings me to my Perrycare medical plan, which will replace Medicare once I consign that Ponzi scheme to the electric chair of history. I don\u2019t have enough time to go into the whole plan right now, but here it is in two words: single prayer. Your next President, Governor Rick Perry

After briefly attempting to recall where they had seen the man before, many people gave up and moved on with their days, but for others, the desperate man\u2019s remarks left a bitter aftertaste. \u201cThere is no excuse for making comments like those, no matter who you are,\u201d Tracy Klugian, forty-seven, of Springfield, Missouri, said. \u201cWho is he again?\u201d Still others showed concern for the man, and expressed hope that, instead of future bids for attention, he would find fulfillment in crafting or some other harmless hobby.

VMINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Many Americans are tired of explaining things to idiots, particularly when the things in question are so painfully obvious, a new poll indicates. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, while millions have been vexed for some time by their failure to explain incredibly basic information to dolts, that frustration has now reached a breaking point. Of the many obvious things that people are sick and tired of trying to get through the skulls of stupid people, the fact that climate change will cause catastrophic habitat destruction and devastating extinctions tops the list, with a majority saying that they will no longer bother trying to explain this to cretins. Coming in a close second, statistical proof that gun control has reduced gun deaths in countries around the world is something that a significant number of those polled have given up attempting to break down for morons. Finally, a majority said that trying to make idiots understand why a flag that symbolizes bigotry and hatred has no business flying over a state capitol only makes the person attempting to explain this want to put his or her fist through a wall. In a result that suggests a dismal future for the practice of explaining things to idiots, an overwhelming number of those polled said that they were considering abandoning such attempts altogether, with a broad majority agreeing with the statement, \u201cThis country is exhausting.\u201d

According to Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, the President\u2019s inflammatory comments, in which he offered full-throated praise for such controversial fields of knowledge as math and science, are sure to come back to haunt the Democrats in November. \u201cIf President Obama was trying to alienate millions of Americans in one speech, mission accomplished,\u201d Priebus told Fox News. \u201cWhen I watched him speak, I said to myself, \u2018Well, Christmas came early this year.\u2019 \u201d While many Republicans expected Obama to walk back his ill-advised praise of knowledge, facts, and evidence, the White House as of Monday morning had refused to do so. \u201cThe President seems to be doubling down on this, which is not surprising,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cThis is a man who never met a fact he didn\u2019t like.\u201d The R.N.C. chairman said that the Party was already creating negative ads that would make extensive use of the President\u2019s polarizing pro-knowledge rant. \u201cThis fall, we will ask the American people, \u2018Do you want four more years of knowledge, or do you want something else?\u2019 \u201d Priebus said. \u201cBecause the Republican Party has something else.\u201d This post is news satire from The Borowitz Report.

I\u2019m not a betting man, but if I had to guess, I\u2019d say that after eight years of Hillary there will be eight years of Michelle, then eight years each for Chelsea, Sasha, and Malia.\u201d   But \u201cnot so fast,\u201d says Democratic strategist Tracy Klugian, who believes such predictions sell Hillary short: \u201cAssuming her current poll numbers hold up in 2024, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Hillary Clinton will be the most popular President in U.S. history.  In that event, the Twenty-second Amendment, which limits the President to two terms, will be repealed and Hillary will run again.\u201d   Mr. Logsdon, however, scoffs at that scenario: \u201cIf the Twenty-second Amendment is repealed, Bill will run again.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

V NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014President Barack Obama received a stern lecture on foreign policy today from a man who almost started a war with Great Britain in July.   \u201cWhen it comes to dealing with foreign countries, President Obama doesn\u2019t have a clue,\u201d said Mitt Romney, who during a summer visit to London caused the biggest international incident between the United States and Great Britain since the War of 1812.  \u201cOnly I have what it takes to bring peace to the Middle East.\u201d           Mr. Romney\u2019s statement about his foreign-policy prowess drew an official response from British Prime Minister David Cameron, who in a tersely worded statement, said, \u201cHah, good one.\u201d   But the G.O.P. nominee pressed on with this theme during several campaign stops today, saying that his trial by fire at the London Olympics had prepared him for foreign-policy challenges ahead.   \u201cDealing with something as straightforward as the Middle East will be like a day at the beach compared to a volatile tinderbox like England,\u201d he said.   Mr. Romney also laid out his plans for bringing a lasting peace to the Middle East: \u201cRight now, the region is chaos.  Entire countries are in uproar, and they are focussing their anger on America. The only way for us to fix that is by attacking Iran.\u201d   In other political news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a four-year high, making President Obama the crappiest socialist in history.

VMONTGOMERY, Ala. (The Borowitz Report)\u2014On Monday, the state of Alabama lost yet another fight to remain in the eighteenth century, extending a losing streak that dates back to the nineteenth century. Alabama, whose first attempt to remain in the eighteenth century took place between 1861 and 1865, has never shown signs of giving up the fight, even after being dealt a string of stunning defeats in the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties.  According to historians, Monday\u2019s loss brings the number of failed attempts by Alabama to more than four thousand. But even with this latest defeat, some of the state\u2019s residents, such as Chief Justice Roy Moore, of the Alabama Supreme Court, remained resolute in their fight to return to a time before electricity and indoor plumbing. \u201cThe United States Supreme Court has decided that it is the twenty-first century,\u201d Moore said on Monday. \u201cI say, \u2018Not in Alabama, it isn\u2019t.\u2019 \u201c Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

According to the survey, which was conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, America\u2019s gun laws, which used to inspire the most derision toward the country from people around the world, now place a distant second. In another startling result, the U.S. Congress\u2019s position on climate change, which in the past had been a leading candidate for making the U.S. the world\u2019s favorite punch line, also finished far out of the money.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a development that the Republican campaign is sure to find troubling, a new poll of likely voters showed nominee Mitt Romney trailing badly behind the empty chair Clint Eastwood talked to onstage at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. When asked the question, \u201cWho cares more about people like me?\u201d thirty-seven per cent of voters responded, \u201cMitt Romney,\u201d while fifty-two per cent said, \u201cChair.\u201d         The poll numbers for the chair represent the largest post-convention bounce for an inanimate object since the nomination of Michael Dukakis, in 1988.

All I can say is, mission accomplished, General.  Pretty smooth.\u201d Even though \u201cthe reason Petraeus started his affair is obvious to anyone with a brain in his head,\u201d Mr. Dorrinson says, he does not expect the mainstream media to investigate his theory any time soon: \u201cThe only person I\u2019ve been able to get interested in this is Karl Rove.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

Trump said on Tuesday morning that he would not participate in the remaining two debates if Hillary Clinton is there. Trump blasted the format of Monday night\u2019s debate by claiming that the presence of Clinton was \u201cspecifically designed\u201d to distract him from delivering his message to the American people. \u201cEvery time I said something, she would say something back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was rigged.\u201d He also lambasted the \u201cunderhanded tactics\u201d his opponent used during the debate. \u201cShe kept on bringing up things I said or did,\u201d he added. \u201cShe is a very nasty person.\u201d Turning to CNN, Trump criticized the network\u2019s use of a split screen showing both him and Clinton throughout the telecast. \u201cIt should have been just me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat way people could have seen how really good my temperament is.\u201d The billionaire said that debate organizers had not yet responded to his ultimatum, but he warned that if he does not get assurances in writing that future debates will be \u201cun-rigged, Hillary-wise,\u201d he will not participate. \u201cI have said time and time again that I would only do these debates if I am treated fairly,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only way I can be guaranteed of being treated fairly is if Hillary Clinton is not there.\u201d Read actual news about the first debate: Amy Davidson on Donald Trump as a failed bully, John Cassidy on Trump\u2019s self-inflicted errors, and Jill Lepore on the fate of the debate.

Now, some of you may recall that during the campaign, I took a slightly different position on Mitt Romney. In fact, I said that Mitt Romney was the worst person in America to run against Barack Obama for President. Well, there\u2019s nothing wrong with changing your mind. In fact, as Mitt Romney himself has proved, changing your mind is the surest path to the Republican nomination. LOL. Why do I no longer think Mitt Romney is the worst person to run for President? Well, I started thinking about that Jet Blue pilot who went off his nut a few weeks ago and had to be tackled by passengers. That dude would definitely be a worse person to run for President than Mitt Romney. Say what you will about Mitt Romney and how he made his fortune by putting thousands of people out of work and how he invented Obamacare before Obama did and all, he has never jeopardized the lives of people on an airplane (that I know of). That is probably because he flies everywhere on a private jet, staffed entirely by undocumented workers.

VLAS VEGAS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014News that Karl Rove\u2019s PAC, American Crossroads, has bought ads attacking Hillary Clinton has sent the Democrat\u2019s stock soaring in Las Vegas, where oddsmakers now say she is virtually guaranteed to be the next President of the United States.         \u201cPeople were bullish on Hillary before this,\u201d said Tracy Klugian, a leading Las Vegas oddsmaker for over forty years. \u201cBut the Rove thing makes it a lock.\u201d After American Crossroads\u2019s historic string of defeats in 2012, \u201cSerious gamblers wait to see who Rove is supporting and then bet the house on the other side.\u201d The oddsmaker\u2019s only concern, he added, was that Rove\u2019s involvement in the race will dry up all interest in betting on Republican candidates for 2016: \u201cRight now I\u2019m offering Marco Rubio at ninety thousand to one and I ain\u2019t getting a bite.\u201d While acknowledging that \u201cthere\u2019s no sure thing\u201d in the world of gambling, Mr. Klugian said that for professional gamblers, betting against Karl Rove is \u201cas good as it gets.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the LeBron James of losing,\u201d he said.

The scheduling of Christie\u2019s endorsement just one day after the K.K.K. luminary\u2019s boost was \u201cobviously far from ideal,\u201d the Trump aide Harland Dorrinson said. \u201cIn a perfect world, you\u2019d like some daylight between Christie\u2019s endorsement and Duke\u2019s statement of support, so they\u2019d each have maximum impact,\u201d he said. \u201cAs major as the Christie news is, we wouldn\u2019t want the Duke thing to get lost in the shuffle.\u201d The aide said that the events of the past twenty-four hours have been \u201cdizzying.\u201d \u201cWhen the Christie thing happened, we were still celebrating the David Duke thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy.\u201d Dorrinson said that the Trump campaign expects an avalanche of endorsements from G.O.P. leaders, white supremacists, and neo-Nazis in the days and weeks ahead. \u201cSure, that\u2019s going to cause scheduling problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are the kinds of problems every campaign would love to have.\u201d

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The reëlection campaign of Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) went into a tailspin on Monday with the emergence of a leaked photograph showing the Senator reading what appears to be an advanced science text. The picture, which appeared on the gossip site TMZ, shows a visibly absorbed McConnell reading a scholarly volume entitled, \u201cThe Man-Made Causes of Global Warming.\u201d For McConnell, who has repeatedly punctuated his public statements on climate change with the claim that he is \u201cnot a scientist,\u201d the scandalous photo threatens to torpedo his reëlection bid. In the hours since the image was leaked, McConnell has plummeted between five and seven points in statewide polls as voters demanded to know what he was doing with the type of book only a scientist would read. Swinging into damage-control mode, McConnell appeared at a hastily called press conference in Lexington and offered a terse denial. \u201cIt is true that I was holding the book, and that the book was open. But I was not reading the book,\u201d he said. Unfortunately for the Senator, that statement may be too little, too late for Kentucky voters, many of whom view McConnell\u2019s apparent dabbling in science as a betrayal. One of those voters, Republican Harland Dorrinson of Lousiville, put it this way, \u201cIn Kentucky, the only thing worse than being a scientist is being a scientist and lying about it.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

Network officials became concerned after the two Presidential nominees, Donald J.

The executives\u2019 alarm spiked when a camera angle intended to show Mr. Holt instead revealed that he was missing from the moderator\u2019s chair. CNN immediately notified law enforcement, which started searching the environs of Hofstra University, all while Clinton and Trump continued barking at each other unabated.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014As the partial government shutdown grinds on into its twelfth day, Americans remain deeply divided over what kind of wild animal they would most like to see Congress mauled by, according to a new poll released today. While a majority of Americans say they would enjoy seeing Congress torn limb from limb by a ferocious bear, there is disagreement over which species of bear would be best suited for that assignment. When asked, \u201cWhat kind of bear would do the best job of savaging Congress with its fearsome paws?,\u201d Americans gave grizzly bears the highest job-approval rating, followed by polar bears, and by black bears in a distant third.         But the poll showed that there was also strong support for the idea of Congress being set upon by a pack of rapacious animals, with rabid hyenas the first choice of many respondents, followed by feral dogs and cats. While insatiable, bloodthirsty mammals were most often cited as the animals Americans would like to see eviscerate Congress, there was significant support for another scenario, involving Congress being consumed by a swarm of predatory insects. Fifteen per cent of those surveyed \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d with the statement, \u201cBeing torn limb from limb by a grizzly bear or devoured by a pack of rabid hyenas is too good for these people. They should be eaten, very slowly, by a colony of hungry fire ants. Yes, that\u2019s it\u2014fire ants. That would be amazing.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VCOLUMBUS, OH (The Borowitz Report)\u2014With just hours until Super Tuesday, a new survey of likely voters indicates that in a matchup between former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, a majority would choose suicide over either candidate. The poll, conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, shows Mr. Romney drawing twenty-one per cent, Mr. Santorum eighteen per cent, and various forms of suicide sixty-one per cent. \u201cThrowing yourself in front of a speeding city bus\u201d was the most popular means of suicide, at twenty-two per cent, with \u201cjumping off the roof of a really tall building or bridge\u201d coming in second, at seventeen per cent. According to pollster Davis Logsdon, the surging popularity of suicide bodes ill for both Governor Romney and Senator Santorum as Presidential candidates in 2012.         \u201cIt\u2019s still early, but even at this stage of the game the prospect of one of those two being nominated shouldn\u2019t be making voters want to kill themselves in these numbers,\u201d Mr. Logsdon said.

VYOUNGSTOWN, OHIO (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Donald J. Trump lashed out at a new target on Monday, blaming his bad poll numbers on the existence of the numerical system. In sometimes rambling remarks at an outdoor rally in Ohio, the Republican Presidential nominee called the numerical system \u201crigged\u201d and unleashed a torrent of abuse on numbers themselves, calling them \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cthe lowest form of life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s why I won\u2019t release my taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re full of goddam numbers.\u201d While Republican candidates in the past have attempted to exploit their supporters\u2019 distrust of math, Trump is believed to be the first nominee to call into question the numerical system itself. Behind the scenes, G.O.P. insiders fretted that, in attacking the very existence of numbers, Trump was veering wildly off message. \u201cHe should be talking about Hillary Clinton, and instead he\u2019s going off on integers,\u201d one insider said. Officially, aides remained upbeat about the campaign and denied reports that Trump was spending an increasingly large portion of each day angrily muttering to himself and chewing on paper.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014 A new poll released Wednesday revealed that people rank President Barack Obama as the worst President since the Second World War, and also blame him for starting the Second World War. While the respondents slammed the President for his handling of the economy, Iraq, and a host of other issues, his perceived role as the primary cause of the Second World War was the biggest drag on his numbers. Even more troubling, when compared to the three leaders of the Axis powers during that war, President Obama polled at the bottom of the list, finishing far behind Emperor Hirohito of Japan.          \u201cFair or not, the American people hold the President responsible for starting the Second World War,\u201d Davis Logsdon, a political-science professor at the University of Minnesota, said. \u201cIf the President hasn\u2019t gotten his version of the story out, there\u2019s only one person to blame for that: Barack Obama.\u201d In other poll results, the most popular President in the survey was Ronald Reagan, widely credited with ending the Second World War.

VMENLO PARK, Calif. (The Borowitz Report)\u2014After Facebook\u2019s shares plummeted in after-hours trading today, Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg issued the following personal letter to all nine hundred million Facebook users. Dear Facebook user: Hey it\u2019s Mark. It seems like just yesterday that Facebook had its historic I.P.O. and, thanks to you, my net worth soared to a staggering $20 billion. What an awesome day that was for both of us. Today was a different kind of day. Facebook shares are plunging because the geniuses on Wall Street expect us to, and I quote, \u201cmake money.\u201d That\u2019s why your Facebook friend Mark needs your help. Facebook only makes money if people click on its ads. Do you know what Facebook ads are? They\u2019re those things on your Facebook page that you have never clicked on even once. But at Facebook we\u2019re looking to change that. After doing extensive market research, we learned that there is one time when people actually do click on Facebook ads: when they\u2019re drunk. This is the same business model that iTunes is based on. I\u2019m sure a few of you have had the experience of using Facebook late at night, only to wake up and find that you\u2019ve gotten seven auto-insurance quotes or enrolled as a criminal-justice major at the University of Phoenix.

VLA JOLLA, Calif. (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney today released the following letter to the American people: Dear American People:  Yesterday, comments I made about poor people made me look terrible. This always seems to happen when I say what I really believe. The fact is, I do care about poor people. That\u2019s because I\u2019m poor myself, when you compare me to Mark Zuckerberg. According to most projections, Facebook\u2019s I.P.O. should net Mr. Zuckerberg a personal fortune of twenty-eight billion dollars.

From coast to coast, viewers reacted with outrage and horror to what many were calling the most incendiary Super Bowl ad in history. \u201cI was enjoying the Super Bowl with my family, and suddenly, out of nowhere, comes this ad suggesting that there are other languages that aren\u2019t English,\u201d said Carol Foyler, a mother of three from Akron, Ohio. \u201cI grabbed the remote and turned it off. My kids shouldn\u2019t be exposed to garbage that\u2019s just going to confuse them.\u201d The Alliance for Responsible Advertising, a conservative watchdog group that monitors advertising it considers offensive and unfit for family viewing, issued a statement demanding that Coke apologize for the controversial ad and promise never to air it again. \u201cLast night, Coke assaulted millions of Americans with its misguided and inappropriate view that other languages exist,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn the future, we strongly hope that Coke will keep its crazy theories to itself.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In what some experts are calling a strong indicator of improvement in the economy, Republicans in recent weeks have begun renewing their claims that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. While most economists agree that any significant improvement in the U.S. economy is generally accompanied by an uptick in G.O.P. questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s place of birth, there is now an econometric tool for measuring the increase in those claims: the so-called S. & P. Birther Index. The Birther Index, established in 2008, measures the occurrences of such words as \u201cbirth certificate,\u201d \u201cKenya,\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t born here\u201d in Republican statements about the President, and has proven to be a surprisingly reliable tool for tracking improvements in the economy.         Harland Dorinson, the economist who devised the S. & P. Birther Index, said that as the economy recovers the index also shows a strong surge in statements questioning the President\u2019s Christianity. \u201cAs unemployment started going down, we saw an increase in references to Mr. Obama being a Muslim,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is generally a very bullish sign for the economy.\u201d But Mr. Dorinson was quick to add that while the surge in references to Mr. Obama being \u201can Islamic socialist born in a mud hut in Nairobi\u201d is encouraging, the economy is not out of the woods yet. \u201cWe won\u2019t be fully in a recovery until the Republicans start calling him a Wiccan,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they start saying he\u2019s a Satanist who practices human sacrifice and drinks the blood of children, then it\u2019ll be time to pop open the champagne.\u201d

According to the constitutional scholar Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, the scenario of Mr. Biden appearing in all the remaining debates, while surely unorthodox, is within the realm of possibility: \u201cAccording to the Constitution, the Vice-President steps in when the President is unable to fulfill his duties. Based on the first debate, that seems to be the case.\u201d Mr. Biden got off to a strong start in the debate, which began with moderator Martha Raddatz asking him and Rep. Paul Ryan, \u201cGentlemen, first question: To the best of your ability, smirk sarcastically at your opponent.\u201d The Vice-President rose to that challenge, smiling broadly and snickering throughout all of Mr. Ryan\u2019s answers, and characterizing them with virtually every Irish synonym for shit. Mr. Biden\u2019s performance clearly wowed the Democratic voters in the post-debate poll, as ninety per cent of them \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d with the statement, \u201cObama should crush a little bit of Joe Biden into a joint and smoke it.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

I pulled him aside and said, \u2018Clint, that will ruin everything we\u2019re trying to do here. Shout at a chair instead.\u2019 And then we were golden.\u201d The \u201csecret video\u201d showing Mr. Romney at a fundraiser was another coup for the campaign, Mr. Rhoades said, adding, \u201cWe actually shot that video ourselves and then \u2018leaked\u2019 it to Mother Jones. It was the simplest way we could think of to take forty-seven per cent of the votes off the table.\u201d Mr. Rhoades admitted that he is gratified by how well the campaign\u2019s plan to offend different constituencies has worked so far, but with only six weeks to go until the election, they are leaving nothing to chance: \u201cThis week, we\u2019re releasing a video of Mitt swinging a cat by its tail.\u201d   Photograph by Lauren Lancaster.

In an e-mail to all Amazon employees issued late Sunday evening, Bezos said that the company would begin grading its workers on empathy, and that the ten per cent found to be least empathic would be \u201cimmediately culled from the herd.\u201d To achieve this goal, Amazon said that it would introduce a new internal reporting system called EmpathyTrack, which will enable employees to secretly report on their colleagues\u2019 lack of humanity. The system will allow Amazon employees to grade their co-workers on a scale from a hundred (nicest) to zero (pure evil), resulting in empathy-based data that will be transmitted directly to Bezos. Then, through a new program called Next Day Purging, any employee found lacking in empathy will be removed from the company within twenty-four hours of Bezos\u2019s termination order. \u201cWe can\u2019t be the greatest retailer in the world unless we are also the kindest,\u201d Bezos wrote in his e-mail. \u201cSo my message to all Amazonians is loud and clear: be kind or taste my wrath.

In interviews across the state, Wisconsinites expressed emotions ranging from dread to panic as they grappled with the realization that Walker would soon be back behind his desk performing his duties. \u201cEarlier this spring, when he was riding high in the polls, a lot of my friends and I were thinking, \u2018This is the break we\u2019ve been looking for,\u2019 \u201c said Carol Foyler of Green Bay. \u201cWe definitely had our hopes up.\u201d Tracy Klugian of Milwaukee agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t know a person in Wisconsin who wasn\u2019t pumped about the idea of Scott Walker going to Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we watched that first debate.\u201d He shuddered at the memory.

While both camps are mum about the vicious hatred that has consumed the two men on the campaign trail, political insiders familiar with the Chafee-Webb blood feud are expecting fireworks in Las Vegas on Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to make predictions about a debate, but one thing is guaranteed,\u201d the political scientist Davis Logsdon said. \u201cThese two men cannot stand each other.\u201d Sources differ over what caused the white-hot hostility between the two former officeholders, but most agree that Webb\u2019s two-per-cent support in some polls deeply rankles Chafee, who has garnered only one per cent. \u201cLincoln is a very, very competitive man,\u201d a source close to the former Rhode Island governor said. \u201cHe thinks he should be the one with two per cent, not Webb, and he\u2019s determined to take Webb down.\u201d Logsdon, the political scientist, said that debate watchers can expect Webb to attempt a knockout punch on Chafee in the early minutes of the debate, but warned, \u201cThat punch had better land.\u201d \u201cThe last thing you want is to turn Lincoln Chafee into a wounded, bloodied animal,\u201d Logsdon said. \u201cHe will lash out and kill you.\u201d For his part, Chafee hopes to attack Webb so brutally that the former senator is knocked out of the race once and for all. \u201cIn a race without Webb, Chafee believes he scoops up Webb\u2019s two per cent, and then he\u2019s riding high, with three per cent,\u201d a source said. \u201cSo Tuesday night could get very, very ugly.\u201d

The Queen\u2019s speech began with the phrase \u201cListen, you Scottish bastards,\u201d and became steadily saltier as the monarch blasted her subjects for having the impudence to consider leaving the fold.  \u201cI\u2019ll make you heel like a litter of [Anglo-Saxon vulgarity] corgis,\u201d she said, as her rage reached a crescendo. After the speech, British Prime Minister David Cameron made a desperate attempt at damage control, hoping to distance himself from the Queen\u2019s paint-peeling rant. \u201cThe views of Her Majesty the Queen are her own,\u201d he said in a hastily prepared statement. \u201cNeither I nor my government consider the people of Scotland \u2018bloody wankers.\u2019 \u201c

V NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The race to become the Republican vice-presidential candidate seemed hopelessly deadlocked today as Mitt Romney announced he would choose between former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, and Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan \u201cas soon as I can tell them apart.\u201d   An aide to the former Massachusetts governor acknowledged that after weeks of vetting, meetings, and even joint public appearances with the three men, \u201cthey have totally blended together for him.\u201d   Mr. Romney\u2019s inability to distinguish Pawlenty from Portman, Portman from Ryan, and Ryan from Pawlenty may have its origins, the aide said, in the prerequisites that the vice-presidential search committee was originally given.   \u201cWe were told to find a white male who was less interesting than Mitt,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd we thought we hit the jackpot with these three. Then this telling-them-apart-from-each-other problem cropped up. I can tell you, it\u2019s a big mess.\u201d   Face-to-face meetings between Mr. Romney and the three men on his shortlist have done nothing to ameliorate the problem, the aide said, \u201cbecause when each of these guys talks to him he starts losing consciousness.\u201d   The campaign has even resorted to creating flashcards with the likenesses of Messrs. Pawlenty, Ryan, and Portman on one side and their names on the back, but to no avail.   \u201cIt\u2019s gotten so frustrating, last night Mitt suggested that maybe we should choose someone who wasn\u2019t white or male,\u201d the aide said. \u201cHe was kidding, of course, but that gives you an idea of how desperate things are.\u201d

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014One day after the former Hewlett-Packard C.E.O. Carly Fiorina announced her candidacy for the 2016 Republican Presidential nomination, a new poll shows that she enjoys extremely high name recognition among the tens of thousands of former H.P. employees she fired. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, Fiorina\u2019s name recognition stands at a hundred per cent among the legions of employees she terminated, with many of them calling the former C.E.O. \u201cunforgettable.\u201d Additionally, a broad majority of the laid-off workers described their feelings about Fiorina as \u201cintense,\u201d and noted that very few days go by when they do not invoke her name in a vehement manner. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the survey for the University of Minnesota, said that Fiorina\u2019s entry into the Republican race had \u201cenergized\u201d many former H.P. employees. \u201cMost of them were apathetic about the race before, but now they are very excited to see how it plays out for Carly Fiorina,\u201d he said. Impressively, Fiorina\u2019s hundred-per-cent name recognition among fired H.P. employees ranks her ahead of other names mentioned in the survey, such as Darth Vader (ninety-nine per cent) and Satan (ninety-seven per cent).

Not only have I never worked on a weekend, I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s done such a damn fool thing.\u201d The Senate Minority Leader added that \u201cif saving this country means working Saturday and Sunday, then I\u2019m not sure this is a country worth saving.\u201d \u201cYes, I know that the fiscal cliff is a ticking time bomb that could destroy the U.S. economy for years to come and take the rest of the world with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI also know that Sunday is Week seventeen of the N.F.L. season and now I\u2019m missing all my games.\u201d Mr. McConnell said that while \u201csaving the nation may be important to be some people,\u201d he worries that forcing the Senate to work on a weekend is setting a dangerous precedent. \u201cFor years, people have run for Congress because they knew that serving here was synonymous with not working,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s going to change all of a sudden, a lot of us are going to feel very betrayed.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In the hopes of appealing to Republican primary voters, candidates for the 2016 Presidential nomination are working around the clock to unlearn everything that they have learned since the third grade, aides to the candidates have confirmed. With the Iowa caucuses less than a year away, the hopefuls are busy scrubbing their brains of basic facts of math, science, and geography in an attempt to resemble the semi-sentient beings that Republican primary voters prize.  An aide to Jeb Bush acknowledged that, for the former Florida governor, \u201cThe unlearning curve has been daunting.\u201d \u201cThe biggest strike against Jeb is that he graduated from college Phi Beta Kappa,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of work to get his brain back to its factory settings.\u201d At the campaign of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, the mood was considerably more upbeat, as aides indicated that Walker\u2019s ironclad façade of ignorance is being polished to a high sheen. \u201cThe fact that Scott instinctively says that he doesn\u2019t know the answers to even the easiest questions gives him an enormous leg up,\u201d an aide said. But while some G.O.P. candidates are pulling all-nighters to rid themselves of knowledge acquired when they were eight, the campaign of Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, is exuding a quiet confidence. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound too cocky about Rick,\u201d said one Perry aide. \u201cBut what little he knows, he\u2019s shown he can forget.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

(The Borowitz Report)\u2014Two days after asserting that President Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, a guy who asked Donald Trump a provocative question at a New Hampshire rally is now the front-runner in the Republican race for President, according to a new poll. The poll, which was conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, shows Muslim Question Guy leading the G.O.P. field with thirty-four per cent as opposed to nineteen per cent for Trump. In interviews with poll respondents, Republicans gave Muslim Question Guy high marks for stating that President Obama was neither Christian nor American and criticized Trump for not being more vocal in his agreement on those points. Minutes after the poll was released, however, Trump was on the offensive, attacking Muslim Question Guy during an appearance on CNN. \u201cPeople who are supporting this guy haven\u2019t done their homework,\u201d the businessman said. \u201cIf you look back over the past seven years, no one has called Obama a foreign-born Muslim more often than I have.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments did little to slow the momentum of Muslim Question Guy, who drew four thousand people at his first official campaign rally in Concord, New Hampshire, where he vowed to take back the country from Muslim clockmakers.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014After stumbling badly on an interview question about Ukraine, the Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump attempted on Tuesday to reassure voters about his geopolitical expertise by adding the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and the former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin to his team of foreign-policy advisers. \u201cDonald Trump always said that, as President, he would surround himself with the best people,\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesperson, Hope Hicks, said. \u201cIn Governor Palin and Dr. Carson, Mr. Trump now has the Dream Team.\u201d Speaking to reporters, Palin dismissed the controversy over Ukraine as \u201cmuch ado about a gotcha question.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump is one hundred and ten percent correct when he says that no one needs to be worrying about Ukraine,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you look Ukraine up on Google Maps, like I just did, it\u2019s right where it\u2019s always been.\u201d Dr. Carson said that, as President, Donald Trump would support the territorial integrity of Ukraine and \u201cits magnificent network of underground grain tunnels.\u201d \u201cI cannot overemphasize the importance of Ukraine\u2019s grain pipeline,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you choke off Ukraine, Europe cannot bake bread.\u201d Trump\u2019s spokesperson said that the additions to his foreign-policy brain trust should give voters \u201cgreat confidence\u201d that a Trump White House would be equal to the challenge of an international crisis. \u201cWhen that 3 A.M. call comes in, and Mr. Trump is busy on Twitter, Dr. Carson and Governor Palin will be there to take the call,\u201d she said.

It\u2019s a well-established fact that dinner is far, far more expensive than lunch. Yet again, Donald Trump entered into a negotiation and won big.\u201d Minutes after the Trump campaign released its statement, Peña Nieto took to Twitter again, where he indicated he had \u201cno intention\u201d of ever having dinner with Trump.

Reached in Honolulu, where he works as an assistant manager at Applebee\u2019s, Laggett said that his speech to Congress would steer clear of personal issues between him and Obama. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave that stuff at the door,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to talk about the job he\u2019s doing as President, which he\u2019s screwing up pretty bad, in my opinion.\u201d At the White House, the President responded testily when asked if he intended to watch Laggett\u2019s speech. \u201cKevin is a tool,\u201d he said.

V NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a dramatic narrative that could upstage this week\u2019s Democratic National Convention, Rep. Paul Ryan (R., Wisc.) gave reporters today a detailed account of the fateful day he killed Osama bin Laden.   Mr. Ryan said that he was revealing his role as the triggerman who felled the Al Qaeda leader to \u201cset the record straight,\u201d explaining that he had remained silent about his mission until now, because \u201cI don\u2019t like to brag.\u201d           The Republican Vice-Presidential nominee painted a portrait of a Paul Ryan few know, a man who trained for missions with SEAL Team Six while somehow finding time to cut key provisions of Medicare.   The Wisconsin Congressman said he was doing sit-ups in the House of Representatives cloakroom when he got the call to deploy for his mission to Abbottabad, and hours later found himself face to face with the world\u2019s most wanted man.   \u201cOsama got one look at me and he ran like a bat out of hell,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s times like that that I\u2019m glad I can run a hundred meters in 9.58 seconds.\u201d   As for the perfect shot between the eyes that nailed bin Laden, Mr. Ryan called it \u201cjust another day at the office.\u201d   \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get too full of yourself because of a thing like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a job to do, and I did it.  It was very satisfying to see all my SEAL training come together.  And it was great practice for the day I got Qaddafi.\u201d    Illustration by Tom Bachtell

Rick Scott, a supporter of the measure. \u201cSpeaking as a Floridian, I have found it exhausting pretending to obey them.\u201d         There is broad support in the state for abolishing laws, according to a poll commissioned by the political action committee Citizens For a Lawless Florida. According to that poll, a majority of Floridians favor ridding the state of laws, while a sizable number did not know that the state had any. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to remove laws piecemeal for the past few decades, but this measure seems like the most efficient way to take care of the whole problem,\u201d Gov.

Trump\u2019s Kasich gaffe occurred at a campaign rally in Des Moines on Wednesday, when the former reality-show star admitted that he did not yet know enough about the Ohio governor to properly insult him. \u201cI could get up here and call Kasich a loser, because my gut tells me that\u2019s what he is, but you\u2019ve come to expect something more special out of me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you bear with me, I promise you that I\u2019ll come up with a world-class insult that we can all be proud of.\u201d The audience reacted with stunned silence, leading some observers to question whether Trump\u2019s failure to insult Kasich would turn from a mere gaffe into a full-blown scandal. Carol Foyler, a Trump supporter who attended the Des Moines event, said that she still liked Trump because of the insults he had delivered in the past, but she acknowledged that her belief in him had been shaken. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the White House and that phone rings, you\u2019ve got to be ready to insult someone right away,\u201d she said.

Presidential candidate Rick Santorum today proposed replacing church and state with a new entity he called \u201csturch.\u201d \u201cMerging church and state into sturch will benefit all Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept maybe Jews.\u201d Mr. Santorum said that the combined entity would offer greater convenience to the American people than the separation of church and state currently does, since Americans would be able to get salvation and motor-vehicle renewals at the same place every Sunday.         Turning to another campaign theme, Mr. Santorum told the crowd, \u201cI support the rights of the unborn child until it is born and wants an education.\u201d He contrasted himself with President Obama on the education issue, stating, \u201cBarack Obama speaks in complete sentences. What a snob.\u201d In other campaign news, singer Kid Rock endorsed Mitt Romney, which means that his music is no longer the worst thing about Kid Rock.

VNORTH CAROLINA (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Flush with victory from yesterday\u2019s statewide vote, supporters of North Carolina\u2019s Amendment One today moved forward with a bold proposal to ban electricity and soap. Cal Pinckton, a leading proponent of Amendment One who has helped craft the new law, says the principles behind it are simple: \u201cIf the Bible doesn\u2019t mention something, it\u2019s against the law, and the Bible makes no mention of either soap or electricity.\u201d He adds that North Carolina will \u201cstill have plenty of stuff that the Bible does mention, like boils and locusts.\u201d         While some critics of the proposed law said that it could be damaging to North Carolina\u2019s economy, since it would drive away fanciers of soap and electricity, Mr. Pinckton sees it differently. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a huge boom in tourism,\u201d he says. \u201cNorth Carolina is on its way to becoming one great big old-timey theme park, like Colonial Williamsburg.\u201d But Mr. Pinckton is careful to emphasize that under the proposed law, there would be certain situations in which the use of electricity would be permitted: \u201cYou could still use electricity for things that are explicitly mandated by the Bible, like transvaginal ultrasounds.\u201d

VAUSTIN (The Borowitz Report) \u2014 A controversial new bill in the Texas House of Representatives would require those running for governor to show proof of the minimum I.Q. necessary to perform the duties of the office. If the bill were to become law, every politician in Texas with gubernatorial ambitions would be issued an I.D. card featuring his or her photo, current address, and performance on a state-administered I.Q. test.  Carol Foyler, one of the co-sponsors of the bill, acknowledged that the idea of a minimum I.Q. for candidates was viewed as incendiary in some circles, but insisted that the requirements of the I.D. card were not onerous. \u201cAll they have to do is show mastery of simple tasks, such as uttering complete sentences and things of that nature,\u201d she said. But the bill faces an uphill fight in the House, where representatives like Harland Dorrinson, of Plano, have vowed to defeat it. \u201cI know that the folks behind this so-called bill are well meaning,\u201d Dorrinson said. \u201cBut if this had been enacted fifteen years ago, it would have choked off our supply of governors.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

Putin spent over six hours consulting with his inner circle of imaginary friends, whom he refers to as the League of Superior Beings.  Attending the meeting were Igor, a powerful brute who can deflect missiles with his bare fists; Dr. Karamazov, who can control the world\u2019s weather; and Ludmila, a sorceress whose powers include the ability to bend time and transform herself into a number of animals and insects. Putin emerged from the meeting energized and upbeat, telling associates that Igor and Ludmila had put aside their usual rivalry to confront the threat of sanctions. According to sources, Putin and his imaginary friends are weighing a broad array of options, including covering Europe in icicles and sending U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to another dimension.

VLOUISVILLE (The Borowitz Report)\u2014With an official announcement on his campaign Web site, Senator Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has joined a crowded field of people who will never be elected President in their lifetimes.  While Paul and Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are the only officially announced Republican candidates with a zero-per-cent chance of ever winning the Presidency, a burgeoning roster of totally pointless candidacies is waiting in the wings. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are just a few of the men thought to be considering squandering time and money pursuing an office that they will never occupy in a billion years. On the Democratic side, only former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley has stepped forward as someone who could only be elected to the White House in an alternate universe. Minutes after his announcement, aides to Senator Paul said that they believed that he would emerge as the top choice of voters who are determined to waste their votes in 2016. \u201cThere\u2019s no one out there who has a more remote chance of being elected, unless Trump decides to run,\u201d one aide said.

The ten narcissists, winnowed down from a longer list of seventeen, will be presented to the nation in a special prime-time broadcast Thursday night. Almost immediately after Fox released the list there was an outcry over its choices, as the seven narcissists who were omitted complained that they were easily as egotistical and self-absorbed as those who made the cut. The president of Fox News, Roger Ailes, called the criticism \u201cunderstandable, coming from narcissists,\u201d but acknowledged that choosing the top ten narcissists in America was ultimately a matter of opinion. \u201cAt the end of the day, whether these ten deserved to be on the list is open to argument,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept Trump, of course.\u201d

Plus, he is supposed to be retired, so he shouldn\u2019t have been wearing his Pope costume.\u201d   Reached at his apartment at the Vatican, Benedict downplayed the incident, saying he \u201cwas just trying to be helpful.\u201d   \u201cLook, Francis is insecure\u2014I get that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s new at being Pope and it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s making so many mistakes.

Explaining his decision, Boehner told reporters, \u201cA lot of the Speaker\u2019s job is administrative, which is time-consuming and tiring. In retirement, I\u2019ll have more time for what I really love: repealing Obamacare.\u201d Boehner said that he plans to begin every day with a good breakfast, some exercise, and a vote to repeal Obamacare before lunch. \u201cNo one knows how much time one is allotted on this planet,\u201d Boehner, striking a somber tone, said. \u201cBut if the Lord above grants me good health, I will repeal Obamacare thousands of times before my journey ends.\u201d

VWashington (The Borowitz Report) \u2014 President Obama has sparked outrage in Congress and renewed calls for his impeachment by signing a daring Presidential memorandum that would pay workers enough to eat. The memorandum, which is based on the President\u2019s view that people should be paid for the hours they actually work, is shaping up as one of the most controversial and incendiary actions of his Presidency. House Republican leaders held a press conference this morning to warn Obama that, by advancing his agenda of paying people for the work they do, he is \u201cplaying with political fire.\u201d         \u201cA Presidential memorandum is a powerful tool and should be used sparingly,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). \u201cIt is not a vehicle for this President to enact his pet theories about people earning enough to survive.\u201d House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) concurred, telling reporters, \u201cWith one stroke of the pen, President Obama is removing the single greatest incentive for work: hunger.\u201d \u201cApparently, President Obama needs a lesson in American history,\u201d he said. \u201cHunger built the railroads.

Senator Harland Dorrinson, one of the many pro-life lawmakers backing the woman ban, crafted his bill after witnessing Senator Wendy Davis filibuster an anti-abortion bill last month. \u201cThat was our moment to say, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThis comes down to a choice between life and women, and we choose life.\u201d         Senator Dorrinson said his bill would call for a twenty-foot woman-proof fence to be constructed along the borders of the state. \u201cWomen are great at talking, but not at climbing,\u201d he observed. But another G.O.P. state senator, Cal Jamson, believes that the total ban on women goes \u201ctoo far\u201d and is proposing a less draconian bill that would allow some women to remain in the state as guest workers. \u201cTexas needs women to cook, clean, and cheerlead,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they show that they can do those things and stay out of politics, there could be a pathway to citizenship.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

I didn\u2019t know whether that CNN dude\u2019s name was Wolf or Blitz. And my only training for running the No. 1 nation in the world was running its No. 8 pizza chain. Yet none of that, I repeat, none of that disqualified me. In fact, I was the front-fucking-runner, as long as I kept my 9-9-9 in my pants. (I have no idea what I meant by that\u2014I just like saying 9-9-9.) But here\u2019s the part that really kills me. You\u2019re kicking me to the curb because I was messing around, and instead you\u2019re going with \u2026 Newt Gingrich? I repeat: Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, I know what you\u2019re saying: you love Newt because he\u2019s an \u201cintellectual.\u201d Well, Newt Gingrich is the intellectual of the Republican field the way Moe was the intellectual of the Stooges. And that leads me to my final point: you disgust me, America. Right now if I had my way, I\u2019d up and move to another country. I really, truly would. Only I don\u2019t know where any of them are, and my wife won\u2019t let me leave the house. Goodbye forever, Herman

But he bemoaned the absence of online consumer reviews that could help people who are, like him and his brother, interested in purchasing a Democrat for the very first time. \u201cYelp needs to jump on this,\u201d he said. While acknowledging the risk inherent in owning their first Democrat, Koch said that it would probably turn out to be a better investment than some of the Republicans they have recently purchased. \u201cIt can\u2019t be worse than Scott Walker,\u201d he said.

Taking comfort from a blanket and a cup of coffee provided by D.N.C. staffers, Whitman appeared to be in a state of shock about where life under a failed state had brought her. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d find myself in a place like this,\u201d she said as she took in the unfamiliar surroundings of the D.N.C. headquarters. \u201cStill, anything has to be better than where I came from.\u201d When asked if she had any regrets about her decision to flee, Whitman choked back tears before responding. \u201cI had no choice,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no respect for human life there.\u201d

Speaking to the newly graduated bathroom-enforcement cadets, McCrory impressed upon them the gravity of their responsibility. \u201cYou are the thin blue line charged with protecting the gender sanctity of North Carolina\u2019s bathrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cBe careful out there.\u201d McCrory told reporters that the thousand officers are only \u201cthe first wave\u201d of a bathroom-patrol force that will eventually swell to over fifty thousand. \u201cThis is job creation at its finest,\u201d he said. In addition to \u201cmaking North Carolina proud of its bathrooms again,\u201d McCrory said, the state\u2019s new law should boost tourism, as visitors from around the world clamor to watch North Carolina\u2019s unique bathroom-enforcement program in action. \u201cEver since we passed this law, my phone has been ringing off the hook,\u201d the governor said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t believe what we\u2019re doing in North Carolina.\u201d

And as God is my witness, as your congressman, I will abuse it again,\u201d he said, to thunderous applause.   Mr. Sanford, who had been behind in the polls in the waning weeks of the race, owed much of his last-minute surge to the support of the lying community, exit polls showed. According to those exit polls, Mr. Sanford held a three-to-one lead among voters who described themselves as liars, cheaters, or sleazebags.   Furthermore, the polls showed, those same voters felt that Mr. Sanford\u2019s opponent, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, did not have the lying experience necessary to serve in Congress.

Why am I doing this after all of these years, you might ask?  Well, I won\u2019t mince words.  I\u2019ve started drinking a little early this Christmas.           Yes, I\u2019m sitting here in my man-cave, panelled in mahogany the color of me, doing a rack of Canadian Club shooters and smoking my way through a carton of Lucky Strikes as if they were the last Twinkies in creation.  If my chief of staff knew that I was writing to you while I was this polluted, he\u2019d shit a phone book. But guess what?  I don\u2019t fucking care anymore.   You see, this will be my last Christmas as Speaker of the House, all because a cabal of Tea Party miscreants in the House of Representatives doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m a ginormous enough asshole for their taste.  Who\u2019s more to their liking?  Virginia\u2019s own Eric Cantor.  As a waiter might say at an all-you-can-eat shit buffet, \u201cExcellent choice.\u201d  How odious is Eric Cantor?  Let me put it this way: when we have to speak to the press, I actually prefer to stand next to Mitch McConnell.     What will life be like under Speaker of the House Eric Cantor?  Well, he\u2019s the guy who recommended cuts in disaster funding just hours after tornadoes hit Joplin, Missouri.  Nice.  And it was his \u201cnever met a dick-measuring contest I didn\u2019t like\u201d pathology that helped create last year\u2019s debt-ceiling crisis.  You can\u2019t put a price tag on a performance like that.  Well, actually you can: it cost the country nineteen billion dollars.  Starting to miss me already, aren\u2019t you?  Fuck you.   So have a very Eric Cantor Christmas, America, and as that smug four-eyed sociopath drives the entire nation off the cliff, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.  Now leave me alone, God damn you.

VCONCORD, N.H. (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The mystery surrounding Colonel Muammar Qaddafi\u2019s whereabouts was resolved today as the dictator announced his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination in a town-hall meeting in Concord, New Hampshire. In announcing his candidacy, the Libyan madman joins a Republican field which is believed to number in excess of seven hundred candidates. While some New Hampshire Republicans seemed surprised to see Colonel Qaddafi shaking hands and kissing babies at the Concord town hall, an aide to the Libyan strongman said his transformation to G.O.P. candidate made perfect sense. \u201cIn those final days in Tripoli he was becoming increasingly disconnected from reality,\u201d said the aide. \u201cSo I think he\u2019ll fit right in.\u201d         Mr. Qaddafi, dressed in his trademark yellow turban and matching robe, got mixed reviews in his first appearance on the campaign trail, with some New Hampshire citizens saying that his six-hour stump speech was badly in need of pruning. Additionally, some felt that his rhetoric needed to be toned down, especially his closing line about fighting for the Republican nomination \u201cuntil the last drop of blood.\u201d But others gave him high marks for his grasp of history and geography, which most agreed was stronger than Michele Bachmann\u2019s. Perhaps underscoring the challenges that lie ahead for Mr. Qaddafi in his quest for the G.O.P. nod, current polls show him in the back of the pack, leading former Senator Rick Santorum but trailing the pizza guy. \u201cUnfortunately for Muammar Qaddafi, he might be out of step with the current crop of Republican candidates,\u201d one pollster said.  \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that he\u2019s too moderate.\u201d

At a presentation for Facebook employees at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Zuckerberg announced plans to build a $24 billion Facebook laser shield, a global network of satellites capable of identifying and incinerating Google drones in midair.           Zuckerberg delighted his audience with a brief animated demonstration showing a Facebook satellite locking in on a Google drone and obliterating it with a green laser.   \u201cUnfriended, bitch,\u201d said Zuckerberg, to a roaring ovation from his employees.   Within an hour, Google responded with a stern warning of is own, vowing, \u201cAny act of aggression against Google drones will not stand.\u201d   To that end, the company announced that it was prepared to shoot down Facebook\u2019s laser satellites with a long-range super cannon called Google Gun.

Mr. Romney and the man made a joint appearance, after which the audience was advised not to operate heavy machinery.

Rogers, said that when parts of the Patriot Act expired at midnight on Sunday, intelligence analysts immediately stopped collecting mountains of phone metadata and started reading billions of Facebook updates instead. \u201cFrom a surveillance point of view, the transition has been seamless,\u201d Rogers said.

VWASHINGTON (Satire from The Borowitz Report)\u2014Adding a new wrinkle in an already unpredictable election year, Donald Trump saw his poll numbers plummet on Monday after receiving a surprise endorsement from President Barack Obama. The long-awaited downfall of the abrasive billionaire came in startling fashion, as few had expected the President to offer a full-throated endorsement of Trump, especially on the eve of the all-important Super Tuesday primaries. Praising the Republican front-runner during a nationally televised address, the President said that, despite media reports to the contrary, Trump shared his views on such important issues as immigration and religious tolerance. \u201cIn every way that matters, Donald and I are on exactly the same page,\u201d Obama said, pointing to a framed picture of the billionaire on his Oval Office desk. Concluding his endorsement with an emphatic closing argument, Obama said, \u201cIf you love me, vote for Trump.\u201d In several G.O.P. polls taken after the President\u2019s stunning endorsement, Trump sank from first to fifth place, trailing the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson by several points. As news of the President\u2019s endorsement spread, former Trump supporters across the nation gathered to vent their anger, with some burning signs, trucker hats, and other campaign paraphernalia at impromptu bonfires. Harland Dorrinson, who had attended a massive Trump rally in Alabama just a day earlier, said that he now felt totally betrayed by the billionaire. \u201cI guess when all is said and done, Donald Trump was just too good to be true,\u201d he said.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014As America\u2019s bridges, roads, and other infrastructure dangerously deteriorate from decades of neglect, there is a mounting sense of urgency that it is time to build a giant wall. Across the U.S., whose rail system is a rickety antique plagued by deadly accidents, Americans are increasingly recognizing that building a wall with Mexico, and possibly another one with Canada, should be the country\u2019s top priority. Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of a Washington-based think tank called the Center for Responsible Immigration, believes that most Americans favor the building of border walls over extravagant pet projects like structurally sound freeway overpasses. \u201cThe estimated cost of a border wall with Mexico is five billion dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could easily blow the same amount of money on infrastructure repairs and have nothing to show for it but functioning highways.\u201d Congress has dragged its feet on infrastructure spending in recent years, but Dorrinson senses growing support in Washington for building a giant border wall. \u201cEven if for some reason we don\u2019t get the Mexicans to pay for it, five billion is a steal,\u201d he said. While some think that America\u2019s declining infrastructure is a national-security threat, Dorrinson strongly disagrees. \u201cIf immigrants somehow get over the wall, the condition of our bridges and roads will keep them from getting very far,\u201d he said.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Exit polls conducted across the country on Election Day indicate a nation suffering from severe memory loss, those who conducted the polls confirmed Tuesday night. According to the polls, Americans who cast their votes today had a difficult time remembering events that occurred as recently as six years ago, while many seemed to be solid only on things that have happened in the past ten days.  While experts were unable to explain the epidemic of memory loss that appears to have gripped the nation, interviews with Americans after they cast their votes suggest that their near total obliviousness to anything that happened as recently as October may have influenced their decisions. \u201cI really think it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d said Carol Foyler, a memory-loss sufferer who cast her vote this morning in Iowa City. \u201cI just feel in my gut that if these people were in charge they\u2019d do a really amazing job with the economy.\u201d Harland Dorrinson, who voted in Akron, Ohio, and who has no memory of anything that happened before 2013, said his main concern was a terrorist attack on American soil. \u201cI really think we need to put a party in charge that won\u2019t ever let something like that happen,\u201d he said. In Texas, exit polls showed strong support for George P. Bush, who was running for the Republican nomination for Texas land commissioner. \u201cGeorge Bush sounds like the name of someone who would be really good at running things,\u201d said one voter.

VMINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014A person\u2019s capacity to generate a large number of e-mails is a key indicator that he or she has the stamina to perform well in a demanding executive position, a new medical report released on Monday asserts. The report, which was conducted by the University of Minnesota Medical School, studied more than five hundred research subjects and found a direct correlation between their ability to generate e-mails and their stamina, alertness, and over-all mental acuity. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve looked at data from stress tests and other traditional diagnostic exams to measure a person\u2019s stamina,\u201d Dr. Davis Logsdon, who supervised the study, said. \u201cBut as we have transitioned to an information age the ability to produce, store, and even delete a huge number of e-mails is a much more accurate measure.\u201d Dr. Logsdon said that, for a high-level executive job such as president of a large organization, \u201cthe capacity to generate tens of thousands of e-mails might be not only optimal but a necessary requirement.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s possible that a person who has not generated tens of thousands of e-mails could still perform well in such a job, but the odds would be stacked against him or her,\u201d he said. A few subjects in the research study who performed exceptionally well were found to have been involved in more than half a million e-mail communications, either as a sender, recipient, or deleter. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to find a human being capable of participating in, say, six or seven hundred thousand e-mails, but we would consider such a person \u2018super-Presidential,\u2019 \u201d he said.

VSACRAMENTO (The Borowitz Report) \u2013 A new poll shows that Americans who were unconcerned about climate change as it wreaked havoc around the world are beginning to worry, now that global warming is affecting the appearance of their lawns. According to the poll, conducted by the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, rising sea levels, the destruction of habitats, and catastrophic weather conditions, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, have not served as the wake-up call to Americans that their lawns\u2019 unsightly barrenness has. In interviews across the state of California, residents expressed anger and outrage that climate change had been allowed to worsen to the point that it has now severely limited their choice of ground cover, shrubs, and other decorative plantings. \u201cWe are being forced to create a front lawn out of stones and, yes, cacti,\u201d said Harland Dorrinson, a resident of suburban Sacramento. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that this is a world I would want to leave to my children.\u201d \u201cRight now we\u2019re looking at a situation where we have to choose between saving our climbing hydrangeas or our roses,\u201d said Tracy Klugian, of San Diego. \u201cWe are no longer living like humans.\u201d Carol Foyler, a San Mateo resident who has watched her lawn turn from a gorgeous green to a hideous brown during California\u2019s drought, said she blamed scientists \u201cfor failing to warn us of the true cost of climate change.\u201d \u201cThey always said that polar bears would starve to death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they never told us our lawns would look like crap.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

As we could have expected, many people are wondering what this transaction will mean to the service that you, our subscribers, will enjoy.

Q: How will the merger affect the price of my cable service? A: There is no clear answer to that. But we will be introducing financing options, roughly similar to those that enabled you to attend college.         Q: Will there be any adverse impact on customer service? A: A technician will be at your home between the hours of eight and never. Q: How frequently will you turn off the Internet, and are you going to deliberately crush Netflix by making it impossible to stream its movies? A: Often and probably. Q: I am a current Time Warner subscriber. Who will be handling customer complaints, Comcast or Time Warner? A: Please address all complaints to Comcast/Time Warner Customer Service, 666 Noonethere Lane, Abysstown, U.S.A. Q: I have been on hold for the past hour, and no one seems to be picking up. How long can I expect to wait? A: Due to concern about the merger, we are experiencing longer-than-expected wait times. In the meantime, eat me.

V NEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014A new poll released today shows the Presidential race extremely tight among voters who had no access to a working television for the past two weeks.   On the campaign trail, Republican nominee Mitt Romney seemed buoyed by the news, urging his audience not to watch television, read newspapers, or log on to the Internet between now and Election Day.   Mr. Romney attempted to rebut Vice-President Joe Biden\u2019s biggest applause line from last night by telling supporters, \u201cOn Day One of my Presidency I will kill General Motors and bring Osama bin Laden back to life.\u201d   As for President Obama\u2019s biggest applause line, \u201cI am the President of the United States,\u201d Fox News said they were fact-checking it.           With the fall campaign officially begun, both Obama and Romney must now spend hundreds of hours and millions of dollars to become President of Ohio.   Only sixty days remain until the election, or in Paul Ryan\u2019s words, \u201cForty days.\u201d     Photograph by Gaia Squarci.

VMOBILE, Ala. (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Exit polls from tonight\u2019s Republican contests in Alabama and Mississippi reveal that former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney\u2019s key obstacle to gaining the G.O.P. nomination is the fact that voters cannot stand him. According to Davis Logsdon, who conducted the polls for the University of Minnesota\u2019s Opinion Research Institute, \u201cDespite his superb organization, funding, and ground game, Mitt Romney is having trouble overcoming the perception among voters that he is a ginormous dick.\u201d Mr. Logsdon said that these obstacles \u201ccould prove fatal to his historic bid to become the nation\u2019s first openly assholic President.\u201d         Exit polls taken today bear out that theory, with a majority of voters agreeing with the statement, \u201cI think Mitt Romney is so odious, I would rather vote for a mental patient in a sweater vest.\u201d The beneficiary of that sentiment tonight was former Senator Rick Santorum, who told supporters at a victory rally in Mobile, \u201cTonight is like the Civil War, only with a happy ending.\u201d Speaking to his supporters in Jackson, Mississippi, Mr. Romney uttered what some political experts are calling a possible gaffe: \u201cI love the South. I\u2019m friends with the guy who owns the banks that foreclosed on all your homes. Y\u2019all.\u201d For his part, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an also-ran in tonight\u2019s contests, remained resolute, telling supporters, \u201cI\u2019m staying in this race.

VWACO (The Borowitz Report) \u2013 Suspects in the recent biker brawl in Waco, Texas, only slightly outnumber the 2016 Republican Presidential candidates, leading some voters to have difficulty distinguishing between the two groups, a new poll shows. According to the poll, voters who were presented the names of a biker-brawl suspect and a Republican Presidential candidate correctly identified both only thirty per cent of the time. For example, fifty-seven per cent of voters erroneously identified the former Texas Governor Rick Perry as a member of the Bandidos motorcycle gang, while forty-one per cent believed he belonged to the Cossacks. Adding to voters\u2019 confusion, the biker brawlers and G.O.P. candidates have identical views on a host of issues, such as gun rights and whether they would feel comfortable attending a gay wedding. While the number of biker-brawl suspects stands at a hundred and seventy, if current trends continue, the Republican field could blow past that number by early summer, possibly deepening voters\u2019 confusion. But, in one positive sign for the Republicans, they notched a higher approval rating than the Waco suspects, five per cent to three.

Tearing into \u201cthe failed economic policies of the Obama Administration,\u201d he argued that children in China are inheriting money from their fathers at a much higher rate than American children are. \u201cWe don\u2019t win at anything anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t win at inheriting.\u201d Trump\u2019s plan for wealth creation drew strong praise from his team of economic advisers, including Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Barron, and Donald Trump, Jr.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a possible setback for Mitt Romney\u2019s latest Presidential ambitions, a new poll reveals that a majority of Americans now regard the former Massachusetts governor as a stalker. The poll results suggest that Romney\u2019s presence in every Presidential campaign in recent memory has taken its toll on the American people, who have expressed disbelief that he would return after being repeatedly told in no uncertain terms that he was not wanted.  Additionally, many of those surveyed said that they previously felt harassed by the Massachusetts governor\u2019s relentless e-mails and phone calls, and favored some form of intervention to keep Romney from contacting them in the future. In an indication of how much Romney\u2019s serial candidacies have traumatized the American people, more than fifty per cent said that they would support a restraining order to keep the former nominee five hundred feet from the United States until the 2016 election had safely passed. In an interview on Monday, Romney said that the inauspicious poll results would not discourage him from seeking the White House for a third time. \u201cI know that I\u2019m the right man for the American people, and nothing they say or do will stop me,\u201d he said.

Minutes after Clinton\u2019s second announcement, an irate Gowdy called her decision to reenter the race \u201cbeyond unethical\u201d and revealed that the committee\u2019s investigators had just uncovered fresh evidence about Benghazi.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The White House\u2019s attempt to portray President Obama as a gun user may have had unintended consequences today, as a newly released photo of Mr. Obama firing a rifle at Camp David set off a panic of gun buying across the U.S. Right-wing opponents of Mr. Obama were behind the frenzied gun sales, saying that they were terrified by the image of an armed and shooting President.         \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound paranoid or anything, but now everything Obama has been doing makes sense,\u201d said Harland Dorrinson, who was waiting on a blocks-long line outside a West Virginia Wal-Mart. \u201cHe wants to take away all our guns and then he\u2019s going to come shoot us.\u201d Learning that Mr. Obama only uses his rifle for skeet-shooting did little to calm Mr. Dorrinson: \u201cSomebody owning a gun just for sporting purposes? Yeah, right.\u201d In an effort to stem the panic, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters today that skeet-shooting took up relatively little of the President\u2019s time at Camp David, and that his favorite leisure activities were \u201cactually badminton and frisbee.\u201d The White House later released a photo of Mr. Obama putting away his gun and never using it again.

VFARMVILLE, VIRGINIA (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The Republican Vice-Presidential nominee, Mike Pence, stunned a national television audience on Tuesday night by using his opening statement in the Vice-Presidential debate to beg the nation\u2019s private sector for a job. Shortly after the moderator, Elaine Quijano, told Pence that he had two minutes to make his statement, the Indiana governor looked directly into the camera and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get right down to it. If you run a company and you\u2019re watching this right now, I beg you from the bottom of my heart to consider hiring me. I need a job and I need it bad.\u201d Pence urged employers to consider his many qualifications and to ignore his role in the 2016 Republican campaign. \u201cAs God is my witness, I take no responsibility for this dumpster fire,\u201d he said. Stressing the urgency of his situation, Pence said that his political career was in ruins and pleaded with employers to visit his LinkedIn profile. As the moderator warned Pence that his time was up, he shouted, \u201cI can start Wednesday, November 9th!\u201d before the camera abruptly cut away. According to published reports, no employers expressed immediate interest in hiring Pence.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In the first term in office, President Barack Obama has broken with a tradition established over the previous eight years through his controversial use of complete sentences, political observers say. New polls indicate that millions of Americans are put off by the President\u2019s unorthodox verbal tic, which has Mr. Obama employing grammatically correct sentences virtually every time he opens his mouth. Mr. Obama\u2019s decision to use complete sentences in his public pronouncements, as well as his insistence on the correct pronunciation of the word \u201cnuclear,\u201d has harmed his reëlection hopes among millions of voters who find his unusual speaking style unfamiliar and bizarre.         According to Presidential historian Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota, after eight years of George W. Bush many Americans find it \u201calienating\u201d to have a President who speaks English as if it were his first language. \u201cEvery time Obama opens his mouth, his subjects and verbs are in agreement,\u201d says Mr. Logsdon. \u201cIf he keeps it up, he is running the risk of sounding like an élitist.\u201d The historian said that if Mr. Obama insists on using complete sentences in his speeches, on Election Day the public may find itself saying, \u201cO.K., subject, predicate, subject predicate\u2014we get it, stop showing off.\u201d Elsewhere, consumers who believed that Nutella was nutritious have won a $3.05 million lawsuit, the highest award ever paid to morons.

The study, conducted by University of Minnesota researchers during Tuesday night\u2019s Republican debate, required subjects to be connected to electrodes to measure their tolerance for the senator. Within four seconds of watching Cruz, the majority of participants begged to be released from the experiment, researchers reported. In a more encouraging finding for the senator, when the same research subjects were exposed to Cruz with his voice muted, they could tolerate him for up to six seconds, the data showed. According to the University of Minnesota\u2019s Davis Logsdon, who supervised the study, the results portend \u201csignificant challenges ahead\u201d for Cruz\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get your message out if, four seconds in, people just start screaming uncontrollably, as many of our participants did last night,\u201d he said.

The White House defended the President\u2019s eating habits, noting that his predecessor, George W. Bush, frequently supplemented his three meals a day with an afternoon snack, but Priebus was unmoved by this argument. \u201cIt sends a very dangerous message to our enemies to see President Obama eating,\u201d he said.

In a prepared statement, the ISIS spokesman said that Trump\u2019s pronouncements about such hotel-industry concerns as air-conditioning and renting the proper-sized ballroom were creating confusion within ISIS, as the group\u2019s leaders struggled to determine how any of the examples applied to them. \u201cWe\u2019re having a very hard time making sense of the speech,\u201d the ISIS spokesman said. \u201cHe talked about defeating us, but it seemed like what he was saying was pretty specific to hotels.\u201d Minutes after the statement was released, Trump responded that the fact that he had confused ISIS \u201cmeans I\u2019m already winning the war against it.\u201d \u201cIn every one of my hotels, you\u2019ve got elevators,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSome of them go up, some of them go down.

As the town-hall audience murmured nervously, Matthews reframed the question for Johnson. \u201cWhat I meant was, Governor, could you name your favorite world leader on this planet?\u201d he asked. Again, Johnson seemed perplexed, before eventually replying, \u201cFrodo.\u201d The Libertarian Party announced on Thursday that Johnson would participate in no additional town halls.

The media will inevitably focus on the personalities of the bloated roster of narcissists lusting after the White House, but scant attention will be paid to the Wall Street bankers, industrial polluters, and casino magnates whose grip on American democracy will remain vise-like.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In a stunning decision on the future of health care in America, the Supreme Court decided today that annual physicals were unconstitutional and should be replaced by random strip searches conducted by the nation\u2019s police. The decision, which appeared to expand the role of the police to include such duties as performing breast and prostate exams, took many in both the health-care and law-enforcement communities by surprise. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, \u201cWhile the Constitution makes no provisions for health care, it explicitly defends the people\u2019s right to form militias; clearly, the Founders believed that if anyone should be looking up our asses it shouldn\u2019t be a doctor, but someone with a gun.\u201d         By replacing annual checkups with random strip searches, the Court raised worries in the health-care community that patients would not get the care they need, but those concerns were brushed aside by Justice Samuel Alito. \u201cUltimately, the responsibility to secure adequate medical attention falls to the citizen,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhen a policeman is searching his body cavities, for example, it\u2019s up to the citizen to say, \u2018There\u2019s a mole I\u2019d like you to look at.\u2019\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he was personally ready for a random strip search/exam at any moment, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing on under this robe.\u201d

Alistair Strott, a journalist and one of George\u2019s most outspoken critics, calls the Prince\u2019s first year \u201clong on hype and short on solid achievement.\u201d \u201cLike a lot of us, I followed the royal birth last year with a great deal of excitement and anticipation,\u201d says Strott. \u201cBut one year in, we all have to look at each other and say, \u2018That\u2019s it?\u2019 \u201c  While defenders of Prince George cite a packed schedule of events during his first year, Strott is unimpressed. \u201cYes, he\u2019s been on TV and magazine covers,\u201d he says. \u201cSo have the Kardashians.\u201d The journalist is not alone in criticizing Prince George, as a recent U.K. poll called his inaugural year the worst first year for a royal baby since the Second World War. Strott acknowledged that George had spent much of his first year in office learning to walk, but added, \u201cIf he\u2019s learned to talk, he certainly hasn\u2019t said anything memorable.\u201d On most of the major issues facing Britain today, from unemployment to its relationship with the European Union, \u201cGeorge has been missing in action,\u201d Strott says. Buckingham Palace has already started the drumbeat of publicity for Prince George\u2019s second year, but Strott remains skeptical. \u201cPeople can call this child \u2018royal\u2019 if they like, but the word I\u2019d choose is \u2018overrated,\u2019 \u201c he says.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The international terror group known as Al Qaeda announced its dissolution today, saying that \u201cour mission of destroying the American economy is now in the capable hands of the U.S. Congress.\u201d In an official statement published on the group\u2019s website, the current leader of Al Qaeda said that Congress\u2019s conduct during the so-called \u201cfiscal-cliff\u201d showdown convinced the terrorists that they had been outdone.         \u201cWe\u2019ve been working overtime trying to come up with ways to terrorize the American people and wreck their economy,\u201d said the statement from Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. \u201cBut even we couldn\u2019t come up with something like this.\u201d Mr. al-Zawhiri said that the idea of holding the entire nation hostage with a clock ticking down to the end of the year \u201cis completely insane and worthy of a Bond villain.\u201d \u201cAs terrorists, every now and then you have to step back and admire when someone else has beaten you at your own game,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one of those times.\u201d The Al Qaeda leader was fulsome in his praise for congressional leaders, saying, \u201cWe have made many scary videos in our time but none of them were as terrifying as Mitch McConnell.\u201d As for the future of Al Qaeda, the statement said that it would no longer be a terror network but would become \u201cmore of a social network,\u201d offering reviews of new music, movies and video games. In its first movie review, Al Qaeda gave the film \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d two thumbs down. Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.  Photograph by Scott J.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report) \u2014 On Tuesday, Senator Joni Ernst (R.-Iowa) responded to the recent measles outbreak with the following letter to the American people:  Hi, it\u2019s Joni! In recent days, you\u2019ve heard about a measles outbreak among children who have not been vaccinated. Like many Americans, you have probably been asking, \u201cHow would Joni solve this problem?\u201d Some in the media have suggested that politicians should not have opinions about vaccinations because we\u2019re not scientists. Excuse me, but that\u2019s like saying people shouldn\u2019t have opinions about flowers because they\u2019re not bees. The fact is, many parents are concerned about vaccinations, and for a valid reason: they\u2019ve read something bad about them on the Internet. But the good news is that there\u2019s an alternative to vaccinations that\u2019s cheap, readily available, and totally safe: bread bags. Take a look at a bread bag. It\u2019s made out of plastic, which means that no microscopic virus can get through it, unless there\u2019s a hole in the bag. That\u2019s why, every morning, my parents sent me to school with bread bags on my hands. You see, measles are a hand-borne virus. You can only catch them through contact with someone\u2019s measles-infected hand. If every child in America would go to school with bread bags on their hands, why, before you know it, measles would go the way of the Macarena (a dance that used to be very popular but has pretty much disappeared). Why hasn\u2019t anyone thought of this before? Maybe because there\u2019s big money behind vaccinations but not behind bread bags. No one makes money on bread bags. They just come with the bread. So do Joni a favor. Tomorrow, send your kids to school with bread bags on their hands. As my mom used to say, \u201cJoni, if there\u2019s a problem bread bags can\u2019t solve, it\u2019s probably not a problem.\u201d To your health, Joni P.S. Important! This will only work if there are no holes in the bags. Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Republicans on Friday expressed bafflement that President Obama had garnered a record-high second-term approval rating despite having turned the United States into an economically devastated, crime-ridden hellhole. Appearing on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the Trump surrogate Rudolph Giuliani said he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d by the disconnect between Obama\u2019s high approval rating and the President\u2019s near-total dismemberment of a formerly strong nation. \u201cThis country used to be a wonderful place to live,\u201d the former New York mayor said. \u201cToday, all you see is a hellscape of smoldering ruins.\u201d Giuliani blamed the mainstream media for not properly informing the American people about the destruction and havoc Obama has wrought since his first day in office. \u201cWe have an unemployment rate of forty per cent and a murder rate of fifty per cent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are losing a million jobs a day to China and hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees are swarming over our border with Mexico. Those are the facts.\u201d He also questioned the methodology used to determine the President\u2019s approval rating. \u201cThese pollsters are just talking to people who are still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not talking to all of the people who have been killed.\u201d Having witnessed their President transform a once-great country into a dystopian nightmare unfit for human habitation, the American people\u2019s decision to give Obama a record-high approval rating filled Giuliani with bewilderment. \u201cMaybe they approve of the job he did founding ISIS,\u201d he said.

Martin Slessky, a former journalist who works for HonestyWatch, a Minnesota-based fact-checking organization, was resting comfortably after suffering what his doctors called a \u201ctotal physical and mental collapse\u201d during Thursday\u2019s debate. Harland Dorrinson, the executive director of HonestyWatch, said he first became concerned about Slessky\u2019s health when the fact checker started having heart palpitations and shortness of breath every time Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, spoke. \u201cI turned to Martin and said, \u2018Are you all right? Are you going to be able to make it through this?\u2019 \u201c Dorrinson said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018I\u2019ll be fine. Ben Carson is starting to talk now; that\u2019ll be soothing.\u2019 \u201c But, moments later, when New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, falsely claimed that he never supported the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Slessky experienced acute dizziness and blurry vision, and was immediately rushed to the hospital. HonestyWatch\u2019s Dorrinson said it was unlikely that he would ask Slessky or any of his other fact checkers to work future Republican debates. \u201cI care about these people,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of them have families.\u201d Speaking from his hospital bed on Friday, Slessky still seemed blindsided by his sudden disintegration. \u201cGoing into the debate, I actually believed that the volume of falsehoods was going to be more manageable this time,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought Carly Fiorina not being there would help.\u201d

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014One day after he was roundly criticized by both parties for his comments about Libya, Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney attempted to burnish his foreign-policy credentials today, telling reporters that \u201cno one has spent more time overseas than my money has.\u201d \u201cMy money has served in banks from Switzerland to Bermuda, and from Bermuda to the Cayman Islands,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cI challenge my opponent\u2019s money to equal that record of service.\u201d Doubling down on his latest theme, Mr. Romney promised that \u201con Day One of my Presidency, I will ensure that American money is safe and secure in secret vaults and underground caves around the world.\u201d         Mr. Romney\u2019s recent foray into foreign policy may have hurt him in a new poll, in which a majority of likely voters agreed with the statement, \u201cMitt Romney is starting to make his trip to the London Olympics look like the pinnacle of modern diplomacy.\u201d An official statement from the Romney campaign did not refer to his latest comments, but indicated that between now and the election Mr. Romney\u2019s schedule would deëmphasize events where he might be called upon to open his mouth.

V VATICAN CITY (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The brave new world of social media torpedoed the chances of a leading papal candidate today, as a Dutch cardinal struggled to explain newly surfaced Facebook photos showing him on a 2007 spring-break romp in Tampa.   Cardinal Bonifacius Steuer had been on the shortlist to replace Benedict XVI as Pope, but his fellow cardinals abandoned him after the startling emergence of the photos, which chronicle Steuer on a seventy-two-hour nonstop-party rampage in Florida.           In the Facebook photo album, which Cardinal Steuer labeled \u201cTampa Phun,\u201d the Dutchman appears at a dizzying array of frat parties and strip clubs, throwing gang signs at the camera and steadily drinking from two Old Milwaukees mounted on a beer hat.   Tracy Klugian, a job-placement specialist who helps papal candidates navigate the labyrinthine Pope-selection process, says that Cardinal Steuer\u2019s downfall should serve as a cautionary tale to all Pope candidates who are active on social media.   \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about becoming Pope, look at every single photo you\u2019ve posted on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d Mr. Klugian says.  \u201cIf there\u2019s someone on your arm who makes you look fallible, crop them out.\u201d   While Mr. Klugian believes that the cardinals\u2019 decision to blackball Steuer was a little harsh, he says that \u201cat the end of the day, they couldn\u2019t live with pictures out there of a Pope in a funny hat.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

One key difference, of course, is that Morsi makes no secret of being a Muslim.\u201d         Mr. Hannity predicted that the two Presidents could have a close working relationship going forward: \u201cI\u2019m sure President Obama has already called Morsi to congratulate him, one Muslim brother to another.\u201d Mr. Hannity said that the election of Mr. Morsi may be just the latest result in a trend that augurs well for Mr. Obama\u2019s own reëlection hopes: \u201cIn recent months, Egypt elected a Muslim, France elected a Socialist, and Kenya elected a Kenyan.\u201d In other Egyptian news, a hospital spokesman said today that former President Hosni Mubarak, declared \u201cclinically dead\u201d just days ago, continues to make a remarkable recovery: \u201cToday he was able to eat, say a few words, and wire four billion dollars to Switzerland.\u201d

VDES MOINES (The Borowitz Report)\u2013Republican Presidential candidates descended on Iowa over the weekend, giving Iowans a rare opportunity to evaluate all thirty thousand hopefuls in one place. The candidates were a big hit with their G.O.P. audience, who attempted to determine which of the thirty thousand would do the best job of eviscerating Obamacare and deporting college students. Attendees gave an especially warm welcome to the businessman Donald Trump, whose potential entry into the 2016 race would instantly raise the credibility of everyone else. In a speech laden with red meat for the Republican faithful, Trump explained how his experience of hosting a reality TV show would prove invaluable in defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). But Iowans reserved their most enthusiastic response for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who laid out an ambitious vision for depriving future generations of a living wage. Asked how he hopes history will remember him, Walker said, \u201cIf I have my way, there will be no one teaching history.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

To save my time and yours, here are answers to three of the F.A.Q.s (Frequently Asked Questions) we\u2019ve been hearing from you: 1. Will I be charged extra for this service? I\u2019m happy to say that the answer is no. While the harvesting and surveillance of your domestic phone calls were not a part of your original Verizon service contract, the National Security Agency is providing this service entirely free of charge.          2. If I add a phone to my account, will those calls also be monitored?   Once again, the answer is good news. If you want to add a child or any other family member to your Verizon account, their phone calls\u2014whom they called, when, and the duration of the call\u2014will all be monitored by the United States government, at no additional cost.   3. Can the National Security Agency help me understand my Verizon bill?   Unfortunately, no. The National Security Agency has tried, but failed, to understand Verizon\u2019s bills. Please call Verizon customer service and follow the series of electronic prompts.   I hope I\u2019ve helped clear up some of the confusion about this exciting new program. But if you have any further questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to call the White House. Joe Biden is standing by.

VCLEVELAND (The Borowitz Report)\u2014After being cut from the official list of Republican National Convention speakers, the former N.F.L. quarterback Tim Tebow said on Friday that he was optimistic that another political party would pick him up to speak at its Convention. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the Republican Party for considering me, even though I\u2019m disappointed it didn\u2019t work out, obviously,\u201d Tebow told reporters. \u201cHaving said that, I believe there\u2019s another political party out there who will be willing to take a shot with me.\u201d But even as he asserted, \u201cI still have a lot of speaking left in me,\u201d insiders expressed skepticism that Tebow would catch on with another party. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the Democrats would want an evangelical anti-abortion speaker at its Convention,\u201d Harland Dorrinson, an agent who represents prominent political-convention speakers, said. \u201cThe Green Party holds its Convention in August, but does Tim Tebow really think he\u2019s going to be asked to introduce Jill Stein? I love Tim, but I think it\u2019s time for him to call it a day.\u201d For his part, Tebow said that, while he waits for another political party to call, he is staying in shape by practicing speeches at his local high-school auditorium. \u201cGod has given me the precious gift of speech,\u201d Tebow said. \u201cI believe my journey is far from over.\u201d

VKETTERING, Ohio (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Hitting the campaign trail one day after the arrival of Superstorm Sandy, Republican nominee Mitt Romney tweaked his position on abortion today, saying he now supports it in cases where it makes people vote for him. \u201cI would make an exception for abortion in cases where the life of my campaign is at stake,\u201d he told a crowd in Kettering, Ohio. Sandy, which slammed into the East Coast last night, was such a powerful weather system that it prevented Mr. Romney from changing his position on abortion for twenty-four hours.         \u201cIt was important for Mitt to come up with a new position on abortion today,\u201d said his campaign manager, Matt Rhoades.  \u201cIt sends a message to the American people that in the aftermath of Sandy, things are getting back to normal.\u201d Mr. Romney made no reference to his comments about eliminating FEMA, which have been declared a disaster area.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014With the first Presidential debate just two days away, G.O.P. nominee Mitt Romney has been working intensively on two skills that have eluded him throughout the campaign: talking and thinking. According to one aide, much of Mr. Romney\u2019s debate preparation has involved rehearsing a slew of prepackaged \u201czingers,\u201d with mixed results: \u201cWe gave him what we thought was a foolproof line about the budget deficit and he somehow turned it into a crack about gay Mexicans.\u201d         Reportedly, Mr. Romney\u2019s practice debates have gone worse than expected, with the former Massachusetts governor getting trounced by a variety of opponents, including the Apple personal assistant Siri. At a joint campaign appearance in Ohio today, Ann Romney attempted to lower expectations for her husband\u2019s performance at this Wednesday\u2019s debate: \u201cWhen Mitt starts working his mouth and goes off on some weird tangent about who knows what, please just tune him out. God knows that\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived all these years.\u201d Mr. Romney also downplayed his debate prospects, telling supporters: \u201cPresident Obama could very well be the greatest debater in human history. He\u2019s Abraham Lincoln, Clarence Darrow, and the Roman orator Cicero put together. Next to that silver-tongued bastard I\u2019m going to sound like someone with a head injury.\u201d Later in the day, Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign released a statement apologizing to people with head injuries.

Sanford added. \u201cWhen he gets in a fix, does he have the presence of mind to lie about his whereabouts? Sadly, I don\u2019t think President Obama passes that test.\u201d   Mr. Sanford\u2019s concerns mirror those of another leading Republican lawmaker, Sen. David Vitter (R-Louisiana).   \u201cIf President Obama honestly thinks he\u2019s dealing with scandals right now, I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t know what a scandal is,\u201d Sen. Vitter said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s very worrisome.\u201d   \u201cWhen you get that three A.M. phone call, and it\u2019s a reporter claiming that a prostitute said you like to dress up in a diaper, are you prepared for that call?\u201d Sen. Vitter said. \u201cIn the case of President Obama, I am afraid that the answer is no.\u201d   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.  Photograph of Mark Sanford by Rainier Ehrhardt/AP.

It was Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry who said, in 1775, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death.\u201d From that moment on, legal scholars have agreed that the Constitution guarantees every American the liberty to be dead. Here at the Alliance, we will fight for your right to be dead to the death. Let\u2019s take a look, if you will, at the Second Amendment of the Constitution, which protects every American\u2019s right to shoot another American. It says nothing about giving the person who is shot health insurance to prevent him from dying.

But in the words of Apple devotee Tracy Klugian, who was present at today\u2019s launch, such expectations are overdone: \u201cMost Apple snobs I know started putting their Apple products before their relationships a long time ago.\u201d    Andy Borowitz will be doing two shows at next month\u2019s New Yorker Festival: Friday, October 5th, with the storytelling group The Moth, and Saturday, October 6th, with Sarah Silverman.

The G.O.P., which has benefited from the support of so-called \u201clow-information voters\u201d in recent years, accused Obama of cynically trying to make people smarter as a way of chipping away at the Republican base. \u201cYou take low-information voters and give them information, and pretty soon they\u2019re Democrats,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Conspiracy theorists believe that the Republican Party did not die from natural causes but was instead the target of an elaborately planned killing, a leading conspiracy theorist has confirmed. Harland Dorrinson, whose basement walls are covered with photos of suspects in the killing of the G.O.P., has spent countless hours connecting those photos with different colors of yarn in the hopes that a larger pattern would emerge. \u201cBecause the Republican Party is one hundred and sixty-one years old, it\u2019s assumed that it was time for it to die,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, that\u2019s exactly what the people who killed it want us to think.\u201d While some conspiracy theorists have focussed on the billionaire Donald J. Trump as the most likely suspect in the death of the Republican Party, Dorrinson favors a \u201ctwo-killer\u201d theory that involves Arizona Senator John McCain and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. \u201cMcCain tapped Palin to be his running mate, and that led directly to people like Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, and Donald Trump being considered credible candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no logical reason why McCain would have chosen Palin unless he wanted to kill the Republican Party.\u201d In addition to the McCain-Palin cabal, Dorrinson is considering a host of other suspects, including the industrialists David and Charles Koch, the Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, and the novelist Ayn Rand. \u201cThe only suspect I have definitively ruled out is Mitch McConnell,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t imagine a scenario where he accomplished something.\u201d

V VATICAN CITY (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In his latest break with Catholic orthodoxy, Pope Francis said today that he was \u201cseriously considering losing the hat,\u201d the tall ceremonial mitre that has long been a signature of papal dress.   \u201cI know I\u2019m going to catch hell for saying this, but it looks kind of dumb,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, you expect me to believe God really cares if I wear a big pointy hat or not? Come on.\u201d           The Pontiff said that he would probably \u201ctry out some different looks, like a baseball cap or something\u201d over the next few weeks, \u201cjust to see what happens.\u201d   \u201cIf a lightning bolt comes out of the sky and cracks St. Peter\u2019s in two, then I guess we\u2019ll know it was a bad idea,\u201d he chuckled.

VDAMASCUS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Supporters of the United States\u2019 twelve-year quagmire in Afghanistan cheered the news today that the U.S. would strive to achieve a seamless transfer of that quagmire to Syria, effective immediately. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, sought to reassure those who were concerned that the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan signalled a wavering of the nation\u2019s commitment to being mired in open-ended military muddles.         \u201cI can tell you, right here and right now, that the U.S. is every bit as determined to engage in an ill-defined, ill-advised and seemingly interminable mission in Syria as we were in Afghanistan,\u201d Gen. Dempsey said. \u201cAll that\u2019s changing is the Zip Code.\u201d General Dempsey said that the same tribal hatreds, sectarian violence, and untrustworthy alliances that made Afghanistan a quicksand-like morass are very much in evidence in Syria: \u201cI am confident that we could be involved in Syria for many, many years before figuring out why we are there.\u201d Harland Dorrinson, executive director of the National Quagmire Institute, a think tank dedicated to promoting the United States\u2019 involvement in intractable conflicts around the globe, said he found General Dempsey\u2019s words about Syria reassuring: \u201cI felt a lot better after hearing what he had to say, and I know a lot of defense contractors felt the same way.\u201d Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Days after Secret Service agents shortchanged a group of prostitutes in Colombia, the international trade group representing hookers downgraded the United States\u2019 credit rating from AAA to B. The strong rebuke from the International Alliance of Professional Escorts came after a Secret Service agent reportedly paid one of its members thirty dollars for an eight-hundred-dollar service, or only four per cent of the stated price. The statement from the International Alliance of Professional Escorts said that in downgrading the United States\u2019 credit rating it was sending a clear message that its \u201cmembers should be aware that doing business with the government of the United States carries with it a significant risk.\u201d         \u201cWe are urging our members to avoid conducting transactions with the United States and to focus on more reliable customers, like the International Monetary Fund,\u201d the statement added. Just hours after the announcement from the escorts\u2019 group, the U.S. Congress passed the following resolution blasting the Secret Service for its actions: \u201cWe strongly denounce the Secret Service for consorting with prostitutes, which has traditionally been Congress\u2019s role.\u201d But it was not all bad news this week for the Secret Service, which today reported a five-thousand-per-cent jump in enlistment.

VCLEVELAND (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The 2016 Republican National Convention became embroiled in another controversy on Tuesday, as Biblical experts accused Republicans of plagiarizing the entire Convention scenario from the Book of Revelation. \u201cThe first thing that struck me, on Night One, was when the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon like blood,\u201d the Reverend Davis Logsdon, of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Divinity School, said. \u201cThat was just too close to be a coincidence.\u201d Logsdon said that another telltale sign of plagiarism could be found in the alarming appearance of Senator Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and retired General Michael Flynn. \u201cThe four of them didn\u2019t ride in on horseback, but it was still clear who they were supposed to be,\u201d he said. By Tuesday afternoon the Trump campaign was pushing back against the plagiarism charges, as campaign manager Paul Manafort told reporters, \u201cI swear to you that no one involved in this campaign has ever gone near a Bible.\u201d \u201cCertain things that we\u2019ve done to spice up the Convention\u2014like having smoke rising from the Abyss like the smoke from a giant furnace, and having the sun and sky darkened by the smoke from the Abyss\u2014have been in the planning stages for weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just a case of \u2018great minds think alike.\u2019 \u201c Despite the controversy, the Convention proceeded smoothly on Tuesday night, as delegates officially nominated a Beast with seven heads, ten horns, and ten crowns on his horns in a traditional roll-call vote.

With our safety constantly at risk from violent intruders, we asked: How can we possibly defend ourselves?  In the immortal words of my dad, the glorious Kim Jong-il: \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a nuke is a good guy with a nuke.\u201d           I sleep safely at night knowing that a loaded nuclear silo is as close as the launch button on my nightstand. And now I understand what Dad, in his genius, instinctively knew: that the world will not be truly safe until every nation has nuclear weapons.

VTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In an effort to underscore his core beliefs leading up to this Tuesday night\u2019s primary contests, former Senator Rick Santorum made a campaign swing through the seventeenth century today. At the first stop of his ambitious journey, Mr. Santorum restated his reason for seeking the White House: \u201cI am running for President today because the position of Spanish Inquisitor is no longer available.\u201d The former Pennsylvania senator served up red meat to his seventeenth-century supporters, telling them, \u201cSince we all agree that contraception is a bad idea, it\u2019s time to take a harder look at electricity and soap.\u201d         Mr. Santorum, who said that in his first day in office he would repeal the Age of Enlightenment, stressed that he had home-schooled all seven of his children: \u201cThat means there are at least eight people in this country who don\u2019t understand evolution.\u201d In a lighter moment, Senator Santorum told his audience what he said was his favorite joke: \u201cA Kenyan, a Muslim, and a socialist walk into a bar. And then he makes everyone get an abortion.\u201d Elsewhere on the campaign trail, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich scored points with this comment on education: \u201cWe should leave no child behind, only wives.\u201d

VMINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Scientists have discovered a powerful new strain of fact-resistant humans who are threatening the ability of Earth to sustain life, a sobering new study reports. The research, conducted by the University of Minnesota, identifies a virulent strain of humans who are virtually immune to any form of verifiable knowledge, leaving scientists at a loss as to how to combat them. \u201cThese humans appear to have all the faculties necessary to receive and process information,\u201d Davis Logsdon, one of the scientists who contributed to the study, said. \u201cAnd yet, somehow, they have developed defenses that, for all intents and purposes, have rendered those faculties totally inactive.\u201d More worryingly, Logsdon said, \u201cAs facts have multiplied, their defenses against those facts have only grown more powerful.\u201d While scientists have no clear understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the fact-resistant humans from absorbing data, they theorize that the strain may have developed the ability to intercept and discard information en route from the auditory nerve to the brain. \u201cThe normal functions of human consciousness have been completely nullified,\u201d Logsdon said. While reaffirming the gloomy assessments of the study, Logsdon held out hope that the threat of fact-resistant humans could be mitigated in the future. \u201cOur research is very preliminary, but it\u2019s possible that they will become more receptive to facts once they are in an environment without food, water, or oxygen,\u201d he said.

VCONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is gaining legions of new admirers by shamelessly pandering to voters who want to hear the truth, critics of the Vermont senator say. According to those critics, Sanders has cynically targeted so-called \u201ctruth-based voters\u201d to build support for his Presidential bid. \u201cPeople come to Sanders\u2019s rallies expecting to hear the truth, and he serves it up to them on a silver platter,\u201d the political strategist Harland Dorrinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very calculated gimmick.\u201d But while Sanders\u2019s practice of relentlessly telling the truth might play well in states that are rich in truth-based voters, like the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire, critics say that his campaign could stall in states where the truth has historically been less important, like Florida. \u201cAt some point in this campaign, voters are going to get truth fatigue,\u201d Dorrinson said. \u201cRight now, the novelty of a politician who doesn\u2019t constantly spew lies is grabbing headlines. But after months of Bernie Sanders telling the truth, voters are going to start wondering, Is that all he\u2019s got?\u201d Dorrinson is just one of many critics who is eagerly waiting for the Sanders phenomenon to come down to Earth. \u201cTelling the truth may be working for Bernie Sanders, but it shows a serious lack of respect for the American political system,\u201d he said.

We caught up with him as he took a breather for the Fouth of July, at his home in East Hampton. First of all\u2014and I have to ask this\u2014\u201cGod particle\u201d? Really? Who started that? I have gotten so much shit for that! (laughs) I don\u2019t know where that started. Probably TMZ or somewhere! Look, if people want to call me that because they like what I do \u2026 well, I\u2019m humbled. It\u2019s cool to know that what you do makes people happy. I love my fans. But God particle? I don\u2019t think so! I can\u2019t even get my iPhone to sync. (laughs) Speaking of what you do \u2026 what do you do, exactly?         Probably what I\u2019m best known for, for better or worse, is making atomic particles have mass. But I don\u2019t want to be pigeonholed as that, because I don\u2019t want to put limits on what I plan to do in the future. Like, right now I\u2019m doing a lot of things that don\u2019t involve atomic particles or mass or anything like that. For example, my menswear line. It\u2019s a joint venture between me and Hugo Boss. It\u2019s going to be called either Higgs Boss or Hugo Boson. Or we may go a whole different way and call it H. Biggy. My branding team is into it right now. I haven\u2019t been this excited about something I\u2019ve been involved in since I created the universe. Also, there\u2019s gonna be a fragrance. There\u2019s been a lot written about tension in your relationship with Peter Higgs, one of the scientists who discovered you. Any truth to the rumors? Peter and I are both very passionate about what we do, and when you put a passionate human being and a passionate subatomic particle together there\u2019s bound to be friction. We fight like brothers sometimes, but it\u2019s only because we care so deeply about what we\u2019re doing and we want to make it perfect. But as far as what happened in the club last week, no, I did not throw a bottle at his head. O.K., be honest, and no false modesty here: Is there anything the Higgs boson can\u2019t do? A: Honest answer? I want to be considered the Michael Jordan of subatomic particles. By that I mean, Michael Jordan might not have been the most physically gifted player in the history of the N.B.A., but nobody worked harder at his game than he did. That\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. Whether it\u2019s giving mass to matter, breaking electroweak symmetry, or explaining the origin of the universe and whatnot, I believe I can do it all. Could you have kept Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise together? A: Shit no! (laughs)

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Amid the growing debate over building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, a new poll shows that voters who strongly favor building such a wall cannot successfully identify the border on a map. Additionally, the more enthusiastic voters are about building a wall, the less likely they are to know where the border is actually situated, the poll finds. Voters who could not correctly identify the U.S.-Mexico border provided no fewer than fifteen alternative locations for it. Nearly twenty per cent of respondents located it along the United States\u2019 border with Canada. Being told that they had incorrectly identified the U.S.-Mexico border did not in any way dampen voters\u2019 enthusiasm for building a wall there, however. To the contrary, voters believed that it would be easier to locate the border once it had a twenty-foot wall. Among voters who could not correctly identify the border, there was strong support for the Presidential candidacy of the billionaire Donald Trump. Ninety per cent of those voters \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d that Trump knew where the border was, as opposed to only four per cent who said that about Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.

VNEW YORK (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The billionaire Koch brothers have approved a controversial plan to shoot cash from cannons directly at voters heading into polling places on Election Day. The plan, which Koch insiders have privately referred to as Operation Money Shot, would distribute as much as seventy million dollars in small bills in the hopes of seizing Republican control of the United States Senate next Tuesday. While most state laws prohibit electioneering within a hundred feet of polling places, the Koch plan craftily skirts that restriction by using high-powered cash cannons, similar to the T-shirt cannons used in sports arenas, which have a range of up to a hundred and fifty feet.  According to a spokesman for the Kochs, \u201cUnder the law, corporations are considered people, and people have always had the right to fire money from cannons at other people.\u201d When news of Operation Money Shot reached Democratic circles several weeks ago, there were howls of protest and threats of a legal challenge, as Democratic leaders complained that firing cash directly at voters about to cast their ballots would be a subversion of the election process. But the Supreme Court upheld the Koch brothers\u2019 plan by a five-to-four vote on Thursday, arguing that spending money on elections was protected by the First Amendment, and that using a cannon was protected by the Second.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014A group representing America\u2019s hostage-takers today blasted President Obama for his repeated comparisons between them and the Tea Party Republicans, calling his remarks \u201cdegrading and hurtful.\u201d   The complaint came from the National Alliance of Hostage-Takers and Blackmailers, a watchdog group that monitors negative images of extortionists in the media.           \u201cAs professional hostage-takers, we never take hostages unless we have a well-thought-out plan, realistic demands, and a clear exit strategy,\u201d read the group\u2019s official statement. \u201cAny comparison between what we do and these inane Tea Party antics are derogatory and unacceptable.\u201d   The statement continued, \u201cFor years, our members have been subjected to offensive Hollywood stereotypes of hostage-takers as crazed madmen, cackling evildoers, and worse. The President\u2019s hurtful remarks only reinforce those negative images.\u201d   Later in the day, White House press spokesman Jay Carney offered an apology to the group: \u201cAs you can imagine, in the heat of a crisis we often say things we don\u2019t mean. The President regrets any hurt his remarks may have caused.\u201d   Mr. Carney said that in order to avoid offending other groups in the future, the President would resist the temptation to call the Tea Party Republicans terrorists, lunatics, or babies.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014Today Speaker of the House John Boehner issued the following letter to the American people:   Dear American People,   Yesterday, your hardworking House Republicans tried, once again, and failed, once again, to repeal Obamacare. And I really thought we had a good chance this time.   That\u2019s because we were all united in our hatred for this infernal and takes-too-long-to-read law. Every last one of us cast his vote to strike it down, from crazy little Paul Ryan to that arrogant bastard Eric Cantor.           And I wish you could have seen the faces of those freshman Republicans as they voted to repeal Obamacare\u2014so innocent, so full of hope and wonder. As I told them yesterday, \u201cYou\u2019ll never forget your first time.\u201d   It\u2019s important for you to know that even as scandals swirl about the cesspool known as the White House, some folks in Washington are still working hard for the American people.   It was a gruelling week for me, what with popping up in front of the TV cameras every five minutes saying, \u201cWho\u2019s going to jail?,\u201d plus trying to rid our land of Obamacare. But I don\u2019t want your thanks. Save that for the dedicated House Republicans who have now voted thirty-seven times to repeal. You can\u2019t put a price tag on that kind of performance. Well, actually, you can: it\u2019s cost the taxpayers over fifty million dollars.   And worth every million, damn it.   One last thing. I know some of you are probably thinking that after suffering this latest defeat, we House Republicans are just going to take our bat and ball and go home. Well, there\u2019s an old saying where I come from: the thirty-eighth time\u2019s the charm.   Courage,   John Boehner   Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

According to the poll, viewers who went into tonight\u2019s debate thinking that Trump was one of the most horrible people that they had ever seen were still totally unprepared for the depths of awfulness he displayed during the televised contest.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014In an escalation of the stalemate gripping Washington, House Republicans voted today to shut down the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that controls reasoning and impulses. The resolution, which passed with heavy Tea Party support, calls for a partial shutdown of the brain, leaving the medulla and cerebellum, sometimes referred to as the \u201creptilian brain,\u201d up and running.         The Tea Party caucus cheered the passage of the bill, which was sponsored by Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who called the measure \u201clong overdue.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) offered no timetable for restarting the prefrontal cortex, telling reporters, \u201cIt will most certainly remain shut down during any negotiations with the President.

Across the intelligence community, the dismissals caught the attention of analysts, who thought such risky behavior seemed out of character for Al Qaeda.         \u201cThe first thing I thought was, this sounds more like the work of JPMorgan,\u201d one analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cAl Qaeda has a reputation for being madmen, but even for them these investments were crazy.\u201d Pressed about the covert mission, C.I.A. Director David Petraeus confirmed today that it had been a resounding success, telling reporters, \u201cIf you\u2019re serious about putting someone out of business, there\u2019s no one better than these JPMorgan guys. One of them can do more damage than a thousand drone strikes.\u201d But General Petraeus may have spoken too soon, as the official Al Qaeda Web site today claimed that the terror organization was on the brink of getting a \u201cmajor financial bailout package\u201d from a consortium of state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran and North Korea. \u201cAl-Qaeda is too big to fail,\u201d the Web site said.

The Kochs, who reportedly had been frustrated by Walker\u2019s poor performance in the polls, finally decided to sell the Wisconsinite after last weekend\u2019s odd pronouncement, in which he seemed to support a border wall with Canada. According to a Koch associate, \u201cIgnorance has always been a part of Scott\u2019s appeal, but that Canada thing was just too much.\u201d After their plan to sell him was announced, the Kochs immediately pulled Walker off the campaign trail for fear that he might say something that would further reduce his dwindling market value.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report) \u2014 In what legal experts are calling a landmark decision, on Monday the United States Supreme Court struck down what many believe to be the main reason the country was started. By a five-to-four vote, the Court eliminated what grade-school children have traditionally been taught was one of the key rationales for founding the United States in the first place.         \u201cThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy for over two hundred years,\u201d said Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority. \u201cGetting rid of it was long overdue.\u201d Calling the decision \u201chistoric,\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia was guarded in predicting what the Court might accomplish next. \u201cLast year, we gutted the Voting Rights Act, and today we did the First Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see what\u2019s left.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

VNEW HAMPSHIRE (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush is hoping to jump-start his lagging Presidential campaign with a new television ad featuring the worst President in U.S. history, campaign aides confirm. With the crucial New Hampshire primary just hours away, the Bush campaign believes it can finish strong by reminding voters of Jeb\u2019s connection to a man who left the nation in smoldering ruins. In the ad, which Bush aides are calling \u201ca fantastic closing argument,\u201d Jeb\u2019s ability to keep the United States safe and create peace around the world is praised by the President, whose decisions helped destabilize the Middle East and give rise to ISIS. Across the state, the ad featuring the worst President in U.S. history is making a powerful impression on voters. \u201cIt brought back a lot of memories,\u201d Carol Foyler, who lost her house in 2007, said. With the ad scheduled to air around the clock until primary day, aides to Bush are hoping that the commercial, persuasive as it is, is not too little, too late. \u201cWe\u2019re kicking ourselves that we didn\u2019t air this sooner,\u201d one Bush aide said. \u201cAn endorsement from [the person who presided over the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression] confers instant credibility.\u201d

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report) \u2013 Americans who are opposed to being shot, a constituency that has historically failed to find representation in Washington, are making a new effort to make its controversial ideas heard in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWhen you bring up the idea of not wanting to be shot with members of Congress, there\u2019s always been pushback,\u201d Carol Foyler, founder of the lobbying group Americans Opposed to Being Shot, said. \u201cTheir reaction has been, basically, \u2018Not being shot: who\u2019s going to support something like that?\u2019\u201d Foyler, however, believes that the right to not be shot, much like women\u2019s right to vote, the right to same-sex marriage, and other rights that were deemed controversial in their day, may be an idea whose time has finally come. \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve been talking about the right to not be shot and people have been looking at us like we\u2019re out of our minds,\u201d she said. \u201cBut recent polls show that a vast majority of Americans, in fact, do not want to be shot.\u201d While Foyler and other anti-being-shot activists believe that Washington may finally be receptive to their radical ideas, Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice-president of the National Rifle Association, is doubtful. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t want to be shot are a very narrow interest group,\u201d he said.

Some have questioned the appropriateness of the President speaking to such an extremist group, especially because in the past it has issued threats against the United States government.  As recently as 2013, for example, the extremists threatened to shut down the entire federal government if their demands were not met. On Tuesday afternoon, the White House defended the President\u2019s decision to speak to the extremists, pointing out that the Administration had also initiated dialogues with Iran and North Korea.

VWASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)\u2014The Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s potential bid for the 2016 Presidency was declared over, on Monday, before it even began, because of a key feature of the American political system that makes a person with integrity ineligible for the White House. According to some experts, the electoral system has developed a number of safeguards over the past few decades to prevent someone with independence and backbone from occupying the Presidency. \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s failure to become a member of either major political party excludes him from the network of cronyism and backroom deals required under our system to be elected,\u201d said Davis Logsdon, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThough that failure alone would disqualify Sanders, the fact that he is not beholden to a major corporate interest or investment bank would also make him ineligible.\u201d  Because of his ineligibility, Logsdon said, the Vermont Senator would be unable to fund-raise the one billion dollars required under the current system to run for President. \u201cThe best source of a billion dollars is billionaires, and Sanders has alienated them,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly he didn\u2019t think this through.\u201d Logsdon said that Sanders might persist in his quest for the White House despite his ineligibility but that such an effort would be doomed to fail. \u201cOur political system has been refined over the years specifically to keep people like Bernie Sanders out of the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system works.\u201d

VMINNEAPOLIS (The Borowitz Report)\u2014A new study, by the University of Minnesota, indicates that fear of contracting the Ebola virus is highest among Americans who did not pay attention during math and science classes. According to the study, those whose minds were elsewhere while being taught certain concepts, like what a virus is and numbers, are at a significantly greater risk of being afraid of catching Ebola than people who were paying even scant attention. Interviews conducted with people who spent math and science classes focussing on what they would be having for dinner or what the student in front of them was wearing revealed the difficulty they are currently having grasping basic facts about Ebola. For example, when a participant of the study was told that he had a one-in-thirteen-million chance of contracting the virus, his response was, \u201cWhoa. Thirteen million is a really big number. That is totally scary.\u201d Davis Logsdon, who conducted the study for the University of Minnesota, puts the number of Americans who did not pay attention during math and science classes at seventy-two per cent, but adds, \u201cI seriously doubt most people will know what that means.\u201d Get news satire from The Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.

V VATICAN CITY (The Borowitz Report)\u2014This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to play out. For Cardinal Bonifacius Steuer, last night was supposed to be a time of celebration, when the Dutchman who had dreamed of being Pope ever since his boyhood days in Rotterdam would finally stand on the balcony at the Vatican, basking in the cheers of thousands of the euphoric faithful.   There are no cheers for Bonifacius Steuer today.  Only empty silence, and time to reflect on what might have been.           \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to lie to you,\u201d Cardinal Steuer said, in his first interview since his bruising defeat. \u201cIt kills me not to be there, not to be in the Vatican doing what needs to be done.\u201d   While Steuer said that he is \u201cnot going to get into that whole blame-game thing,\u201d he sounded bitter when he spoke about the mainstream media. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t allowed to see me for who I was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey made me look like I\u2019m some rich, rich guy, when you know that I\u2019m as poor as a church mouse.\u201d   But what closed the deal for Pope Francis, Steuer believes, was his outreach to the poor, which the Dutchman calls a \u201cfailed policy of the past.\u201d   \u201cLook, if you go around saying, \u2018the poor this, the poor that,\u2019 you\u2019re going to get a lot of support from people who want free stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cFrancis\u2019s campaign, if you will, focussed on giving targeted groups a big gift.\u201d    Reflecting on the two-day conclave that chose someone else, Steuer was philosophical: \u201cWe were on a roller coaster, exciting and thrilling, ups and downs. But the ride ends. And then you get off. And it\u2019s not like, oh, can\u2019t we be on a roller coaster the rest of our life? It\u2019s like, no, the ride\u2019s over.\u201d   Steuer said it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to talk about his future plans, but that he first intends to sit down with his closest advisers to reflect on what went wrong this time around. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and I\u2019m going to be like, \u2018Come on, guys, don\u2019t hold back,\u2019\u201d he said.   But even as he sounded an aggrieved note as he spoke about \u201cthe hand I was dealt,\u201d Steuer seemed to reserve his harshest criticism for one person: himself. \u201cLook, at the end of the day, this is on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was all about getting enough Catholic votes, and I didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d    Get the Borowitz Report delivered to your inbox.
