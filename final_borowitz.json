former pennsylvania senator rick santorummy fellow americansi am writing to you today to endorse mitt romney for president of the united statesnow some of you may recall that during the campaign i took a slightly different position on mitt romney in fact i said that mitt romney was the worst person in america to run against barack obama for president well theres nothing wrong with changing your mind in fact as mitt romney himself has proved changing your mind is the surest path to the republican nomination lolwhy do i no longer think mitt romney is the worst person to run for president well i started thinking about that jet blue pilot who went off his nut a few weeks ago and had to be tackled by passengers that dude would definitely be a worse person to run for president than mitt romney say what you will about mitt romney and how he made his fortune by putting thousands of people out of work and how he invented obamacare before obama did and all he has never jeopardized the lives of people on an airplane that i know of that is probably because he flies everywhere on a private jet staffed entirely by undocumented workersi also started thinking about michael vick he was involved in some of the most despicable acts in recent memory involving the deaths of multiple dogs mitt romney on the other hand has only endangered the life of one dog his own and he didnt actually kill the dog he just literally scared the shit out of it so if you compare mitt romney to someone who has actually been responsible for the killing of dogs and not just scaring them to death i would have to say michael vick would be slightly worse than him although in some ways slightly better since michael vick did not create obamacare or have gays on his staffin conclusion my fellow americans mitt romney is a total douche no ones arguing that he isnt but if you compare him to either the insane jet blue guy or a heartless dog killer like michael vick mitt romney is no longer the worst person in america to run for president i should add however that if anything should happen to mitt romney between now and november such as him getting trapped in his swiss bank vault with all his ill gotten money and tragically suffocating to death i stand ready and willing to be your nominee plus i am an actual christian who does not believe in magic underpantsvote for romneyrick santorum"], ["\u201cWe Are
