Like many Americans, you have probably been asking, \"How would Joni solve this problem?\"Some in the media have suggested that politicians should not have opinions about vaccinations because we're not scientists. Excuse me, but that's like saying people shouldn\u2019t have opinions about flowers because they're not bees.The fact is, many parents are concerned about vaccinations, and for a valid reason: they've read something bad about them on the Internet. But the good news is that there's an alternative to vaccinations that's cheap, readily available, and totally safe: bread bags.Take a look at a bread bag. It's made out of plastic, which means that no microscopic virus can get through it, unless there's a hole in the bag. That's why, every morning, my parents sent me to school with bread bags on my hands.You see, measles are a hand-borne virus. You can only catch them through contact with someone's measles-infected hand. If every child in America would go to school with bread bags on their hands, why, before you know it, measles would go the way of the Macarena (a dance that used to be very popular but has pretty much disappeared).Why hasn't anyone thought of this before? Maybe because there's big money behind vaccinations but not behind bread bags. No one makes money on bread bags. They just come with the bread.So do Joni a favor. Tomorrow, send your kids to school with bread bags on their hands. As my mom used to say, \"Joni, if there's a problem bread bags can't solve, it's probably not a problem.\"To your health,JoniP.S.

Adolf Hitler was one of the horrible villains in world history, and comparing President Putin to him was uncalled for.What I should have said, and what I say to you now, is that this Putin chap can be a bit Hitlery at times.Let\u2019s take, for example, his penchant for taking territory that doesn\u2019t belong to him and then adding it to his country and so forth. Would you call that behavior Hitlery or not Hitlery? From where I sit, it\u2019s more like something Hitler would do than something he wouldn\u2019t do, and so the verdict must be, yes, the chap is being rather Hitlery when he does that.And, while we\u2019re on the subject, what about Putin\u2019s use of tanks? Also very Hitlery. Again, let me be clear: I am not calling him Hitler\u2014but if you think you can use tanks and not come off a tad bit Hitlery, you\u2019re not right in the head.Since I made my remarks, some British politicians have suggested that I abdicate my position as Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne.

PutinThey say love is like a polar bear. If you want to take it in your arms and hug it, first you must be sure that it is properly drugged. Or perhaps love is like a tiger. If it escapes from the zoo and starts charging at you, you must shoot it with a tranquilizer dart. Whether it is a polar bear or a tiger, though, one thing is true: you must make love drop to the ground, preferably with some kind of drug, or it will maul you to death and eat you.I was lonely, vulnerable. I had just come off a relationship that had seemed so promising, but now she was far away, in Siberia. It is true that I had sent her there, but the fact remained: I was alone.Did I mention that love is like Siberia? I should have, because love can be quite cold sometimes. And it also can seem very far away, which Siberia is. (Unless you are in Siberia yourself.)So there I was, lonely and vulnerable, the tranquilized polar bear of my heart lying in an unconscious white furry heap at my feet.And that\u2019s when I saw her. On TV.I had never seen such a beautiful face, such a lithe and lissome frame. I had never seen such a delicate and precious creature as this, and I have hang-glided with endangered cranes.I summoned my houseboy, Dmitri, who joined me in front of the TV. We watched in silent wonder for a minute or so, and then I asked him, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d\u201cI believe in America that is called \u2018twerking.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cI must have her.\u201dDays passed. With Dmitri\u2019s aid I sought her out. We tried Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I sent her a Vine video of me kickboxing a tranquilized shark. No response.I went to St. Petersburg for the G20. All around me, people were speaking of Syria, but all I could think about was my goddess with the foot-long tongue.Love is like a flock of endangered cranes. It will take you soaring into the clouds, but if you are not careful it will send you hang-gliding into the side of a mountain, your brains falling to the earth in tiny gray jelly bits.I excused myself from the G20, saying that I was trying to solve the crisis in Syria. In actuality, I was calling Dmitri to see if she had Vined me back.\u201cHave you heard anything from her?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo, but I have some \u2026 discouraging news. From TMZ.\u201d\u201cTMZ? What is TMZ?\u201d\u201cIt is like KGB. They seem to have information on everyone.\u201d\u201cWell?\u201d\u201cIt seems that she has a boyfriend. Someone named Liam.\u201dI put down the phone and looked out the window, at the gray skies of St. Petersburg. My heart suddenly felt like frozen tundra, and my love, a drugged polar bear, was about to fall to that tundra with the bear-like thud that bears make when they fall down suddenly. It was as if all the endangered cranes had suddenly tumbled from the sky, shot down by the antiballistic missiles of cruel fate. Love was a lot of things, it seemed to me, and all of them were pretty bad.But then it occurred to me: a love such as the one I had for the one who twerked so majestically might come around only once in a lifetime. Who was I to give up on such a love? Who was this Liam to stand in my way?I picked up the phone again and spoke to Dmitri.\u201cI want Liam shot with a tranquilizer dart.\u201dI put down the phone. Love is a lot of things, I have learned\u2014bears, tigers, cranes\u2014but why try to define it? When all is said and done, love means shooting at something and making it fall down.

In fact, as Mitt Romney himself has proved, changing your mind is the surest path to the Republican nomination. LOL.Why do I no longer think Mitt Romney is the worst person to run for President?

That dude would definitely be a worse person to run for President than Mitt Romney.

That is probably because he flies everywhere on a private jet, staffed entirely by undocumented workers.I also started thinking about Michael Vick. He was involved in some of the most despicable acts in recent memory, involving the deaths of multiple dogs. Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has only endangered the life of one dog, his own, and he didn\u2019t actually kill the dog, he just literally scared the shit out of it. So if you compare Mitt Romney to someone who has actually been responsible for the killing of dogs and not just scaring them to death, I would have to say Michael Vick would be slightly worse than him (although in some ways slightly better, since Michael Vick did not create Obamacare or have gays on his staff).In conclusion, my fellow Americans, Mitt Romney is a total douche. No one\u2019s arguing that he isn\u2019t. But if you compare him to either the insane Jet Blue guy or a heartless dog-killer like Michael Vick, Mitt Romney is no longer the worst person in America to run for President.

It says nothing about giving the person who is shot health insurance to prevent him from dying. This cherished constitutional right to shoot people and make them dead is currently recognized in all fifty states, most recently Florida.In commenting on the Affordable Care Act this week, Justice Samuel Alito compared the Obama health-care plan to burial insurance.
