Like many Americans, you have probably been asking, How would Joni solve this problem?Some in the media have suggested that politicians should not have opinions about vaccinations because were not scientists. Excuse me, but thats like saying people shouldnt have opinions about flowers because theyre not bees.The fact is, many parents are concerned about vaccinations, and for a valid reason: theyve read something bad about them on the Internet. But the good news is that theres an alternative to vaccinations thats cheap, readily available, and totally safe: bread bags.Take a look at a bread bag. Its made out of plastic, which means that no microscopic virus can get through it, unless theres a hole in the bag. Thats why, every morning, my parents sent me to school with bread bags on my hands.You see, measles are a hand borne virus. You can only catch them through contact with someones measles infected hand. If every child in America would go to school with bread bags on their hands, why, before you know it, measles would go the way of the Macarena (a dance that used to be very popular but has pretty much disappeared).Why hasnt anyone thought of this before? Maybe because theres big money behind vaccinations but not behind bread bags. No one makes money on bread bags. They just come with the bread.So do Joni a favor.

It is true that I had sent her there, but the fact remained: I was alone.Did I mention that love is like Siberia? I should have, because love can be quite cold sometimes. And it also can seem very far away, which Siberia is. (Unless you are in Siberia yourself.)So there I was, lonely and vulnerable, the tranquilized polar bear of my heart lying in an unconscious white furry heap at my feet.And thats when I saw her. On TV.I had never seen such a beautiful face, such a lithe and lissome frame. I had never seen such a delicate and precious creature as this, and I have hang glided with endangered cranes.I summoned my houseboy, Dmitri, who joined me in front of the TV. We watched in silent wonder for a minute or so, and then I asked him, What is she doing?I believe in America that is called \u2018twerking.\u2009I must have her.Days passed. With Dmitris aid I sought her out. We tried Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I sent her a Vine video of me kickboxing a tranquilized shark. No response.I went to St. Petersburg for the G20. All around me, people were speaking of Syria, but all I could think about was my goddess with the foot long tongue.Love is like a flock of endangered cranes. It will take you soaring into the clouds, but if you are not careful it will send you hang gliding into the side of a mountain, your brains falling to the earth in tiny gray jelly bits.I excused myself from the G20, saying that I was trying to solve the crisis in Syria. In actuality, I was calling Dmitri to see if she had Vined me back.Have you heard anything from her? I asked.No, but I have some   discouraging news. From TMZ.TMZ? What is TMZ?It is like KGB. They seem to have information on everyone.Well?It seems that she has a boyfriend. Someone named Liam.I put down the phone and looked out the window, at the gray skies of St. Petersburg. My heart suddenly felt like frozen tundra, and my love, a drugged polar bear, was about to fall to that tundra with the bear like thud that bears make when they fall down suddenly. It was as if all the endangered cranes had suddenly tumbled from the sky, shot down by the antiballistic missiles of cruel fate. Love was a lot of things, it seemed to me, and all of them were pretty bad.But then it occurred to me: a love such as the one I had for the one who twerked so majestically might come around only once in a lifetime. Who was I to give up on such a love? Who was this Liam to stand in my way?I picked up the phone again and spoke to Dmitri.I want Liam shot with a tranquilizer dart.I put down the phone. Love is a lot of things, I have learned bears, tigers, cranes but why try to define it? When all is said and done, love means shooting at something and making it fall down. That, I have learned, is the most modern love of all.Photograph by Oleg Popov/Reuters."], ["McCain Accuses Obama of Thinking Before Using Force | The New Yorker", "September 12, 2013", "https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/mccain-accuses-obama-of-thinking-before-using-force", "WASHINGTON  Sen.

But as Ive found in the past, money usually takes care of that.Q: What do you need to do to persuade the right wing of your party that youre one of them?A: Well, first and foremost, I have to do a better job of convincing them that I believe in the crazy things they do. The problem is, the media keeps emphasizing aspects of my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that make me sound sane, like when I gave people in Massachusetts health care.

This is a clear case of media bias, and I wish it would stop.Q: How are you working to change the perception that youre sane?A: Well, obviously, by saying stuff that makes me sound like Im off my rocker. Sheldon Adelson has been super helpful with this. If I could just channel that guy, Id be ready for the booby hatch! I mean, you want to talk about a few bricks shy of a load.

As thousands have gathered in Lower Manhattan, passionately expressing their deep discontent with the status quo, we have taken note of these protests. And we have asked ourselves this question:How can we make money off them?The answer is the newly launched Goldman Sachs Global Rage Fund, whose investment objective is to monetize the Occupy Wall Street protests as they spread around the world.

Furthermore, as clashes between police and protesters turn ever more violent, we are making significant bets on companies that manufacture replacements for broken windows and overturned cars, as well as the raw materials necessary for the construction and incineration of effigies.It would be tempting, at a time like this, to say, Let them eat cake. But at Goldman, we are actively seeking to corner the market in cake futures. We project that through our aggressive market manipulation, the price of a piece of cake will quadruple by the end of 2011.Please contact your Goldman representative for a full prospectus.

Well, actually, on my very first day Im going to repeal the Renaissance. And also the theory of evolution.

In fact, I said that Mitt Romney was the worst person in America to run against Barack Obama for President. Well, theres nothing wrong with changing your mind. In fact, as Mitt Romney himself has proved, changing your mind is the surest path to the Republican nomination. LOL.Why do I no longer think Mitt Romney is the worst person to run for President? Well, I started thinking about that Jet Blue pilot who went off his nut a few weeks ago and had to be tackled by passengers. That dude would definitely be a worse person to run for President than Mitt Romney. Say what you will about Mitt Romney and how he made his fortune by putting thousands of people out of work and how he invented Obamacare before Obama did and all, he has never jeopardized the lives of people on an airplane (that I know of). That is probably because he flies everywhere on a private jet, staffed entirely by undocumented workers.I also started thinking about Michael Vick. He was involved in some of the most despicable acts in recent memory, involving the deaths of multiple dogs. Mitt Romney, on the other hand, has only endangered the life of one dog, his own, and he didnt actually kill the dog, he just literally scared the shit out of it. So if you compare Mitt Romney to someone who has actually been responsible for the killing of dogs and not just scaring them to death, I would have to say Michael Vick would be slightly worse than him (although in some ways slightly better, since Michael Vick did not create Obamacare or have gays on his staff).In conclusion, my fellow Americans, Mitt Romney is a total douche. No ones arguing that he isnt. But if you compare him to either the insane Jet Blue guy or a heartless dog killer like Michael Vick, Mitt Romney is no longer the worst person in America to run for President. I should add, however, that if anything should happen to Mitt Romney between now and November, such as him getting trapped in his Swiss bank vault with all his ill gotten money and tragically suffocating to death, I stand ready and willing to be your nominee.

At the National Alliance of Funeral Directors, we couldnt agree more.It was Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry who said, in 1775, Give me liberty or give me death. From that moment on, legal scholars have agreed that the Constitution guarantees every American the liberty to be dead. Here at the Alliance, we will fight for your right to be dead to the death.Lets take a look, if you will, at the Second Amendment of the Constitution, which protects every Americans right to shoot another American. It says nothing about giving the person who is shot health insurance to prevent him from dying. This cherished constitutional right to shoot people and make them dead is currently recognized in all fifty states, most recently Florida.In commenting on the Affordable Care Act this week, Justice Samuel Alito compared the Obama health care plan to burial insurance. Coincidentally, burial insurance is the Republican health care plan, and one that we enthusiastically support.

(LOL)Here is why I am writing to you today: on Tuesday, you will go to your caucuses and choose from among a field of Republican Presidential candidates. And let me tell you, the idea of any of these people getting nuclear weapons scares the shit out of me.This is just one of many differences between your country and mine. In North Korea, we lock up the criminally insane. In America, you let them debate on TV. Right now you have people running for President I would not trust to take care of my plants.So who do I recommend you vote for on Tuesday? In a word, me.If you think about it, I am the most Republican candidate of all. In North Korea, we have no taxes. We have achieved that through a conservative policy of no jobs. Also, we have no wasteful big government programs providing food, shelter, or safe drinking water. And am I pro life? Well, try this on for size: I believe that life begins at conception and ends at starvation.Now, I know what youre thinking: Im too young to be President, since Im under thirty five. Well, who would you rather have running your country, someone whos under thirty five, or someone whose I.Q. is under thirty five? (LOL)I think when you look at all the facts, voters of Iowa, youll realize that Kim Jong un is the Republican who most deserves your vote. And if youre still not convinced, remember this: at least Im not Mitt Romney.Peace out yo,Your Supreme Leader"], ["A Farewell from Herman Cain | The New Yorker", "June 15, 2012", "https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/a-farewell-from-herman-cain", "Dear Friend,And when I say friend, I mean it in the normal way, not someone Ive been sleeping with for thirteen years.

And my only training for running the No. 1 nation in the world was running its No. 8 pizza chain. Yet none of that, I repeat, none of that disqualified me. In fact, I was the front fucking runner, as long as I kept my 9 9 9 in my pants. (I have no idea what I meant by that I just like saying 9 9 9.)But heres the part that really kills me.

Oh, I know what youre saying: you love Newt because hes an intellectual. Well, Newt Gingrich is the intellectual of the Republican field the way Moe was the intellectual of the Stooges.And that leads me to my final point: you disgust me, America.

How will Facebook be any different from the dot com bubble of the early 2000s?For one thing, those bad dot com stocks were all speculation and hype, and werent based on real businesses. Facebook, on the other hand, is based on a solid foundation of angry birds and imaginary sheep.Second, Facebook is the most successful social network in the world, enabling millions to share information of no interest with people they barely know.Third, every time someone clicks on a Facebook ad, Facebook makes money. And while no one has ever done this on purpose, millions have done it by mistake while drunk. We totally stole this idea from iTunes.Finally, if you invest in Facebook, youll be far from alone. As a result of using Facebook for the past few years, over nine hundred million people in the world have suffered mild to moderate brain damage, impairing their ability to make reasoned judgments.
